Transcriber: Michael - Thank you, Michael!"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Primal Diet Workshop in Nevada City, California

Welcome to our workshop with Aajonus Vonderplanitz."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He's here to talk to us
about raw food, about becoming more healthy, about detox."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Aajonus came into our
lives a couple of years ago, and we've never been the same since, and we've been
sharing these many blessings with our friends, and telling you all about it, and
so here he is today to tell us some more."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Thank you Jill. [
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Clapping]Hello!
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Has everyone read the book?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Or are there some people who haven't read the book?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Anybody who hasn't read the book?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",4 people.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, I'm just going to then take a
few moments for the people who haven't read it - I'm an individual who was very
very ill since birth, almost died when I was 10 years old from a reaction to the
polio vaccines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They gave me peritonitis, misdiagnosed as appendicitis, when I
actually had perforated intestine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They treated me for appendicitis wrongly,
shot me with antibiotics about every 3-4 hours plus pain medication, by the time
I was 13 I started with angina pectoris, which are terrible muscle spasms around
the heart."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I would pass out, they let me lie down on the floor in classroom for
about 20 minutes because they didn't know what else to do."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","By the time I was 16,
I had to start taking insulin although I refused to until I was about 19."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Few
times I did take it, I didn't like it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","By the time I was 19 I got a stomach
ulcer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The treatment of that gave me stomach cancer.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The treatment of that gave
me blood and bone cancer, and the treatment of that gave me lymphoma."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I did not
go back for the ...ha ha ha...verification of the lymphoma."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And they just said
'well you know, there's nothing really we can do, we can try to extend your life
a few months by taking more chemotherapy, but it's doubtful it'll work.'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I was
already an invalid."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","To get from anywhere was a great chore because if I stood up
I passed out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So what I'd do, is I'd sleep on the couch, live on the couch, and
when I had to go to the kitchen to get something to eat or to the bathroom, I
rolled off on the floor and scooted across the floor with my elbows."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And
sometimes it'd take me 1/2 hour to get to the bathroom."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's how ill they made
me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And that was mainly from the treatments.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",In the book I talk about that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The first part of the book is a story - how my son was in an automobile
accident when he was 22 years old, fractured his skull, about 1/5th of his brain
was damaged."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They said no one had lived with that kind of brain damage, and that
he would never recover."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So the story is about how I helped him recover using raw
foods, and how I came to understand and know what I knew to help him by going
through my own health challenges."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So basically that is the gist of what you'll
get in the book."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Then in the 2nd part of the book are raw food remedies for hundreds of
diseases."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And they work 85% of the time.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If it didn't work 85%, I didn't put it
in the book."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There are lots of remedies that worked less frequently, but I
didn't put those in the book because there's just not enough room."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What I'd like to go over today is something that I haven't done in the last 2
workshops that I've done here in the last 2 years, is mainly focus on
detoxification and the healing process."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",This diet is not a magic bullet.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I never
found a magic bullet."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I've searched for magic bullets.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Pills, and the particular
one food that will do it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",This bark.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Or this herb.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Or, this HGH."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Some human
growth hormone."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",This was the key that will change your whole life around.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Never
found such a thing in my exploration."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I haven't found anybody else who has,
either."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Some people have been helped tremendously because they were absent maybe
just one particular nutrient, and they had those kind of miraculous reactions."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But they are far and few in between.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","This diet provides the nutrients necessary
to supply your body on a daily basis to regenerate and to re-supply all of the
vitamins, enzymes, and minerals cauterized, lost, and destroyed from cooking
processes or any kind of processing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Whether it's heat or dehydration.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because
they destroy nutrients."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I remember one fellow was talking with a doctor and
said 'well, your body has those enzymes.'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yea, your body has them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And it will
leech from every part of your body, every cell in your body, every time you eat
a cooked meal."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's absent in enzymes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Has heterocyclic amines, it has lipid
peroxides."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Has all these poisons which are carcinogenic over a period of a
lifetime."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","To reverse all of this, it takes lots of enzymes, lots of vitamins, to
be able to accomplish that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So I'm one of those 100% raw fooders.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When you've
been where I've been, and you've crawled around on the floor to get to anywhere
you're going, and nobody's there to help, because you know if you ask anybody to
help you, they're gonna end up putting you in the hospital if you pass out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So,
I refused all help except for 2 days a week, a person from a hospice."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","A
volunteer would come over and do some shopping for me, and another would clean
the house."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Basically that's how I learned about raw foods, with this one
volunteer, came in drinking carrot juice and said 'I want you to read this
book.'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It was a very short book, maybe 82-86 pages."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It was about this woman who
reversed her cancer by drinking a gallon of carrot juice a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That introduced
me into raw foods."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It changed my life instantly.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","How it did that, was because I
had dyslexia."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I had dyslexia so badly, that if I looked at the printed page, it
swirled."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I got vertigo, and I'd vomit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Back in the 50s when I was learning
to read, you were not allowed to follow your words with your finger."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They said
that slowed your reading ability."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But they didn't understand that if I didn't
use my finger to hold the page down, I'd vomit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I was 22 years old before I drank this carrot juice.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Within about 10 days of
drinking it, my dyslexia disappeared."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I had to cheat my way through schools, to
get through college, I had to have oral exams, at all times."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And all the
professors told me, they said 'sure we can help you out, but if you can't read,
you will never make it in this society.'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Great support.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There's nothing I can
do."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's like...telling a cripple, 'you can't live without your legs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Sorry.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You'll never be accepted in society.'
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But this carrot juice reversed that, and
then I stopped drinking it, vertigo returned, drank it again, it would go away,
it would return again when I stopped, and then it'd go away again every time I
drank it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So, I learned at 22 years old that raw foods was probably a good
therapy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","By 1972 when I was...25 years old, I made the commitment to totally raw foods."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Feb 1972.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And I do them completely now.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","According to Pottenger's work...does
anybody know about Dr. Francis Pottenger?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He did work with lots of raw foods, he
did work with...an experiment with 900 cats over a 10-year period, feeding them
various diets."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He found that it took...the cats who ate cooked foods got all the
diseases of humans, and to get well again it took 5 generations."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","For us, getting
well, to optimal from ill health will take 40 years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","From the day you start
eating a good raw food diet, 100%."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's not a bad average, that's about 2.5% a
year."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Let's say your body is NYC.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Could you imagine revamping NYC at 2.5% a
year?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Impossible.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The body is pretty miraculous to be able to do it at that rate.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It isn't 'the
pot of gold is at the end of the rainbow.'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","As you go along, you get better."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There are detoxifications all along the way, especially if you've been a cooked
starch eater."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because the AGEs that form from all starches, whether they're
cooked or raw, store at a rate of 70% in a healthy body and a rate of 90% in an
unhealthy body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","NYC medical university did research on AGEs which are...you take
carbohydrate, your body converts it into a glycogen, your body uses glycogen
which is a blood sugar, and then the byproduct of that is AGEs, glycotoxin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The
body reads most of cooked starches as already having been utilized."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So instead
of converting it from a carbohydrate into a glycogen, it goes right from a
carbohydrate into an AGE."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Which is a glycotoxin.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you're storing that
immediately directly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What that leads to is candida, herpes, all kinds of skin
problems in a lot of people."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","In other people, it will break down their glands."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If those toxic sugars store in the thyroid, it can cause hypothyroidism."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It can
damage the liver."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It can damage the pancreas.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And lead to diabetes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Innumerable
diseases."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And that doesn't include, which I've already mentioned, the
heterocyclic amines, which are protein toxins that are formed from cooking."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Those are radically dangerous to the nervous system and to the hormone
development, or the hormone synthesis of all glandular activity, even
prostaglandins."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Hormones are considered extra-cellular tissue.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you
have...when your liver produces a hormone or your testes or your ovaries, that
is a hormone."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When you have an intra-cellular hormone-like development or
secretion, that is called a prostaglandin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","All of these sugars, these AGEs
interfere with the cells being able to form their own hormones."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Intra-cellular
hormones."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So the cells break down.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","With all of our immense processing that we have today, McDonalds, everything's
in a package, rarely is anything fresh, these toxins are accumulating at an
advanced rate."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And we have the chemicals, the processing, the preservatives, the
pesticides, add that to it, and then we're pretty toxic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Cancer in 1955 was at a
rate of 1 in 1000 died of cancer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Just read an article from the Sun Magazine,
march issue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Can't remember the doctor's (physician's) name.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He said that 1 in 2
males now get cancer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",1 in 3 females get cancer.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's up.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Just from last 2
years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's pretty extraordinary.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And then you say well, you know, we've been
cooking foods for at least 10000 years, we know that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Or at least 8000 according
to Jewish heritage."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",8000-some years.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Cooking all along the way.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Of course there
were some raw fooders in the Bible, like Abel."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Cain, his brother was a
vegetarian."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Slain his brother who was a meat-eater.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Abel was a raw food meat
eater."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Very passive guy.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",His brother who was a vegetarian was not very passive.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Slew his brother.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Hitler was a vegetarian.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I've known a lot of vegetarians,
including...I was one for 6.5 years, and I had quite a temper."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","My sugar level
would go off instantly, I had low blood fat level, to protect my nervous system,
so I would get irritable very easily."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now you'd have to beat me into the ground
to get me that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",To become hostile.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The whole idea that vegetarians are
more calm and collective because they don't eat meat is an absolute myth."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now
there are some people who are more affected by the poisons in cooked meat, yes,
the heterocyclic amines and the lipid peroxides."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It will irritate their nervous
system or their glands, and cause them to be more irritable."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Or just as
irritable as most of the vegetarians I know."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","These collection of toxins is what
I'm going to get to today, how can they be removed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The body uses 3 methods.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It
makes solvents, just like we have de-greasers."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Soaps.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","80% fat, 15% protein, 5%
alcohols that it makes from eating carbohydrate that'll ferment."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Turn to alcohol
in the body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Go in and dissolve tissue.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now the byproduct is almost identical to
turpentine and it is as toxic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So there's a low-grade nausea that's created from
it and some depression."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It destroys lots of bacteria.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The second method is bacteria and virus.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Bacteria and virus can go in and feed
on degenerative tissue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Breaking down the cellular toxicity.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Not the chemical
structure, because that still has to be done with solvent process."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And if you
don't have bacteria or virus, or parasites, your body has to use the solvent
process which is very very slow."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The bacteria and viral process works about 2.5
faster than your body can use a solvent."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So bacteria is good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's 2.5 times
less toxic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I thought it was 50% less toxic but in the research that I've done
in the last year and half, it looks like it's 2.5 times less toxic than the
turpentine-like substance."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The third is parasites.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Uhh...parasites, my God."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Quickest workers you can have.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Only time it's dangerous is when you're in 3rd world countries and you're
dealing with people who only eat cooked grains, carbohydrates."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Live on cereals
like in India."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because those tapeworms do not live on the tissue, they live on
the food."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If those tapeworms did not exist, those people would die very quickly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Those children would die earlier.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because your body cannot store that much AGEs
in your body without completely turning it into an acid like coca-cola and
dissolving the body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So those tapeworms are even good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And they feed on AGEs or
carbohydrates that aren't even converted yet, right in the intestines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When raw food is adminstered to any of those people who have that, guess what
happens?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","3 months, the tapeworms gone."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Minimum.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you cut out carbohydrates
completely and put them on a raw meat diet, they're gone in about 10 days."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They
actually will just come apart, and you'll pass them out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Some people have
vomited them, but not very many."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Parasites are a wonderful thing.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They work 5
times faster than your body can use a solvent to remove degenerative tissue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Most people don't even know they have parasites, until somebody diagnoses and
tells them and they go have all of these dewormers."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And they've just annihilated
their best friend."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Most people who have parasites don't even know that they're
working because the byproduct is so non-toxic that the body doesn't notice it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The nervous system doesn't notice it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","With bacteria there is some identification because of the veritoxins produced
by virus and bacteria."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But that's all favourable.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They found that at the
university of Toronto in association with the hospital for sick children of
Toronto that the veritoxin produced by E Coli will completely dissolve tumours
and the blood vessels going to the tumours in 7-5 days with one injection."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Dr.
Low at Yale has done the same thing with Salmonella."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Only he does it, he says,
he's created a genetically different salmonella than our normal salmonella,
because that way he can patent it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But if you just ingest anything with bacteria and let your meat rot, stuff like
that, you will be getting all the veritoxins you need to help reverse cancer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Now I use rotten meat to help reverse diseases.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",This is all about bacteria.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","A
scientist named John Monroe just published some of his work."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He used EDDSes -
that's an electronic machine like a computer, they wire you up, they send in
signals, and then they come back as biofeedback, and they can diagnose your
situation, your conditions."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They also have a paradigm of what some healthy
individuals had and then they will send those electrical currents into your body
to adjust your whole electro-magnetic system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now if those who have read my appendix X, that's the therapy I was talking
about that wiped me out for quite a few months, because it doesn't look at you
as an individual, and say 'you need this, because of this, because of this', it
sets you up as a paradigm for about 8 incredibly unusual healthy people -
astronauts, that this whole program was designed to facilitate."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","because when
you're in a capsule, you can't deal with anything else."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You need to go in there
and violate the organic nature of things and take care of it, or else you're
going to lose some 3 billion dollar, 4 trillion dollar apparatus that's floating
up in the sky."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When they identify you with these and send these electrical
impulses in there, they are structured on the paradigm of a few individuals."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And
it doesn't match but a very very very few people, a rarity of people on this
planet."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So what it does is it confuses your entire system.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now John Monroe, a man who's been working with this, working with programs in
that neighborhood just found something out. -"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",about his own machine.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now I don't
know if it's because he heard about my appendix X, and what it did to me, but in
one of his experiments, he took people who normally got 2-4 colds or flus a
year."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He worked on annihilating, inactivating the viral bodies that create colds
and flus."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","For 1 full year, none of these people got a cold or a flu."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The side
effect was that they got clinical depression."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He did not identify it as the lack
of virus or bacteria."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Kept plugging along, trying to find out what is was,
nothing worked."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So he re-introduced the viral bodies again.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","People got the colds
and flus again, but the depression went away."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I've been utilizing high bacteria to take people out of depression - clinical
depression - for a long time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",About 4-5 years.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I waited until...you're the first
group that gets to hear this."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I've been waiting almost 5 years to utilize this
to make sure that it worked in all circumstances."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Not all circumstances, not all
cases would eat the rotten meat, so those I can't tell you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But all those who
did do it, and there were about 17 people who utilized in the last 5 years,
whenever they got clinical depression or any kind of depression at all they ate
rotten meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They'd come to my door, 'got some more of that rotten meat?'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It'd
be so rotten that you'd wanna vomit if you smelled it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Up to 5 months old.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","In
the refrigerator."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",In a jar.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Take it out once a week, twice a week, let it air."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You do it outdoors, don't do it in your house."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And let it air.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And
these people will take just small amounts and just cut it like a capsule size
and then swallow it down with milk."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And if you plug your nose, you don't smell a
thing and it doesn't taste."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But that's what they will do.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And it worked in every
case."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","One girl had cancer of the kidney, cancer of one of the adrenals, and cancer of
the hip, and in her right breast."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","This girl had been in chronic fatigue since
the age of 20 years old till she was 27, till she went on the diet."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Still did
not break that chronic fatigue for about 1 year and 9 months."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It took her to
break it on the diet."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","She still was irritable to an extent and she still had
depression."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The healthier she got, the more depression she got because the more
energy she got, the more frustrated she was because there was still that certain
amount of inertia that was built up for so long."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","All of a sudden she wanted to
do something and didn't know what to do, and depression resulted from that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So
finally after 2.5 years I persuaded her to try high meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That comes from
Eskimos."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Eskimos ate a lot of high meats.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That means bacteria-high, rotten, fish
or beef."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Or caribou is mainly what they had.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So she took this, and I mean I had
some...I had done a workshop somewhere and had gotten a fresh deer, so I took
some of the glands home with me, lung, liver, spleen, pancreas, all those
things."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And I put some in some jars and let them mold.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So they were about...some
as old as 3 months when she started having them and up to 5 months."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Within 2
months of taking this...she was about 2.5 years on the diet already."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But only
after 2 months of taking these high meats, this girl was the kindest, most
affectionate, gentle, could not get her angry, could not upset her at all, never
depressed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",In just 2 months.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How often did she take it?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",She took about a marble-sized amount every week for about 3 weeks.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And that's
all."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Large marbles.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","One a week for 3 weeks, and then she let about 5 weeks go
by, and then she did it again."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",About 3 large marbles worth.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Did she detox a lot?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, initially she got some headaches, migraines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That will result, of course,
if you've got that bacteria going down eating all this degenerative tissue and
all this bacteria's starting to make everything work again, and your body
becoming rooted with nature again."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There are going to be some

byproducts that need to be removed,."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If it gets high in the blood, in the
lymph, you're going to have some reactions whether it's dermatological, blood
pressure for headaches, irritability, whatever it might be."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Those transitions
people will go through."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Everybody goes through some kind of detoxification, some
side effect of that process."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Interestingly enough though, 95% of the time
they're exactly the symptoms that you've already gone through anyway."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Let me give you an example...oh let me finish that conclusion of John Monroe
who did the electrical dermal stuff."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He concluded that virus are ways that all
life forms can communicate rapidly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because they get in and they can alter RNA
and DNA."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",We know the virus do this.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So from one species to another, it's the
quickest way to communicate, because those virus can go to plant, animal,
anybody."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And he said it was like a process of symbiosis where everybody can stay
in tune with what's happening."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","On a planetary level, ecological level."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And that
was a nice way to put it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I didn't make my conclusion that grandiose, I'm more
focused right on what happens physiologically."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But I thought that was a nice
evaluation, or a nice conclusion from his work of what happens when you destroy
virus and the depression that's created."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And when you re-introduce the virus,
the happiness that's created."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So it's all part of you keeping in connection with
everything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because people mainly get depressed because they don't feel
connected, and goes on a cellular bacterial viral level."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Now back in September I started going through a detox.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I started eating a lot
more decomposed nerve tissue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Like rotten brain.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Rotten spine.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Boy you talk
about rotten, that is the worst stench of all."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now the reason I did this is
because in my cancer therapies when I had all of the tumor growing here, they
irradiated me back in 1968, there were no holds barred on the intensity and the
rads that were utilized in radiation therapy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",They completely burned my spine.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I
could not touch my knees."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I couldn't bend over.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","In 1976 I began eating meat,
1977 I had my first spinal meningitis."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I thought I was going to die.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I was
coughing, it was like an intensified flu, doubled with triple pneumonia and I
was filling up, in 5 hours I could fill up an entire bath towel with mucous."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",This went on for about 5 days.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I went into a coughing jag one night that lasted
6 hours."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I was in a NY apartment, so I had neighbors, up above me and below on
one side."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Knocking on my door with bottles of antibiotics.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Trying to help me.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And after the 6 hour jag, they called the paramedics during it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And of course
I'm coughing like hell and the paramedics are there banging on the door, and I'm
saying 'go away, go away, I'm okay, I've just got a terrible flu."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Go away!'
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So
they left me alone."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But there were times when it was just like after the
radiation therapy and chemotherapy when I was so crippled that I was crawling on
my elbows."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",My back was in excruciating pain.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It took about 4.5-5 months to
recover from that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I was sore in the back, I was sore everywhere."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But when I
finished the regeneration from that, I could touch my shins."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I went through it
again 10 years later, I could touch the floor."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I could actually put my palms to
the floor if I worked at it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Without bending my knees.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Last September my spine started again in the lower back.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","One place that it had
never really gone."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The spinal meningitises prior to that mainly stuck from my
waist all the way up to my brain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And this one started in my lower spine.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I
noticed it during sex."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","After 1/2 hour of the whole up and down, all of a sudden
I started feeling very sore."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And I could start feeling the pain.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I knew
something was happening, I thought 'low grade', so went on and on and on and
on...sometimes it was worse than other times, then all of a sudden in February
25-28th, it hit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",All of a sudden I started feeling very very sore.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I have a
crossbow that's 150 lbs, and the prod on it broke, so I had to re-mold and
construct one because this is an old wood one that they don't make any more."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And
I couldn't get a part, so I had to do this whole artistic thing, and mold it and
create this prod to go on it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I went to string it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When you string a crossbow
that's 150 lbs, comes out to a 300lb stretch."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I went down to string this and
the muscles right here in my lower back ripped out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I was on the ground
instantly in pain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I knew that...I thought about that and I said 'wait a minute,
I'm going through months and months of lower back trouble, I should know not to
exert that'...I should've taken it to the bow shop and just had them string it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But I didn't.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So the detox and repair became extraordinary.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I had a black tie
event that I had to go to 24 hours later."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I had hot water bottles that I put
on the area just to get circulation in there, and I took a pain formula."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Pain
formula works 95% of the time, from last year I even got it up higher."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Pain
formula is:

2 raw eggs

4oz cream

If you can't get regular cow's cream, then use coconut cream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","5 level tbsp of fresh soft bee pollen, refrigerated."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If it's not refrigerated, it's dried, dehydrated, and won't work as well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Or

it's kiln-dried and won't work at all."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The juice of...1 tbsp-1.5 tbsp, depending on your particular individual need,

I suggest you use your intuition to decide that, of either lemon or lime

juice."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You blend that for about 50 sec.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What I prefer doing is blending it in a 12oz
jelly jar."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you get an oster or an osterizer blender, you know the bowl, the
canister where you blend everything in?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You unscrew the base of that, take the
blades and the washer off, put that away forever."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Unless you're gonna have a
party and share smoothies with everybody."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But you take these jars, you have 4oz,
8oz, 12oz, pint, quart jars that these blades will screw right on."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Makes it very
easy for blending."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It keeps the oxygen level down so you're not oxidizing your
food as much."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So this 12oz container holds that particular recipe.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Nicely.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Blend
that for 50sec, eat it with cheese."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now I've been telling people to drink 5oz
every few hours as necessary, after 2-5 hours drink 2-3oz more and eat a little
cheese with it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",We have potlucks in LA every 2 months.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","We have a potluck, maybe
40-50 people come and we share all this, everybody's recipe for raw meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's a
great celebration."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Every 2 months.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And they asked me to speak, and I'll speak."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",One woman got up and gave her testimony about the pain formula.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But she wanted
to address how she took it differently than what I recommended."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","She was a woman
who was 39 years old, she has had menstrual cramps since the age of 12, that put
her in bed 3 days a month."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Literally in bed, she cannot move, the pain is so
severe."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","She woke that morning with the pain, the cramping."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","She went to the
kitchen, forced herself up, made the pain formula, drank it all at one time,
with the amount of cheese that I told her to eat which was for the whole thing,
1/4-1/3 brick of cheese."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Cheddar works a little bit better if you're a person
who gets migraines it's better to use the other cheeses."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And only cuts it down
maybe 5% of its value of its therapy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","She drank the whole thing at once and ate
all the cheese at once."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","For the 1st time in her life she did not have any cramps
for the rest of that time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",They went away in 20-40 minutes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So it's a great
formula, everybody loves it, it even works for migraines, I couldn't get it
until I had the cheese and other things involved."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Didn't work for migraines
before, this now works for migraines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You can add honey to it, right?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You can add 1tsp of honey if you like.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Only a tsp.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What kind of cheese?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Cheddar.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The raw no-salt-added cheddar cheese.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You can use any of the other raw
no-salt-added cheeses like the Monstro or the Monterey."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But the cheddar for some
reason works a little better."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Homemade?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I've never tried it with homemade.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You can do that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Do you have pain at all
anytime?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You're not good for my experiment.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So, the pain formula works when you're going through these heavy detoxes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I had
quite a few of those."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now this is before this girl got up and gave her
testimonial, so I always did my 5oz, then 2-4oz every few hours."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I had that
and had nothing else but some golf-ball sizes of meats in between my pain
formula."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I went to that black tie affair, I took an Ace bandage and wrapped it
around my waist, and I actually...I had to get up slowly, and move slowly, but
nobody really noticed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The next day I was laid up and in bed again for a week.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I was crawling around on my elbows, just like after all of the medical
therapy for cancer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I was in pain.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Headache, everything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I had to crawl
everywhere."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","To make my food, to do everything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The pain formula would bring it
right down to a point where it's easily tolerated."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I just wish I had
experimented and drank it all at one time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Each day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Instead of
spreading it out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And since that time, I went into...which was about 2 months
ago, I was still going through it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because 2 months ago is basically... we were
still in the first few weeks of when I did that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So after I heard her give that
testimony I tried it, I drank it all at one time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",For the whole day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And for 2
days I'd go without pain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Except for little stiffness, just a little bit of ache
when I got up or sat down in a particular position for a while."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","On
April...almost 2 months to the day, I woke one morning, got out of bed, forgot I
had the pain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because every morning that I got up, 'uhh', it was back again."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That morning I got up, no pain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It was all over.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's been a week now.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'm able
to stretch again."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","For the first time since before the cancer therapies, I was
able to sit on the floor and put my legs out and drop them to the floor."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I've
not been able to do that for 30-some years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I've still got 4.5-5 months to go to
heal from that detoxification."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But always, you have to understand that on this
diet it doesn't stop your detoxifications, which you call illness, sickness,
whatever it is."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","All illness, sickness, is trying to get rid of the toxins that
are stored in your body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Whether it's your own degenerative tissue or pollution
that you've put into it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you panic, you'll run off to a doctor, get
antibiotics, all this stuff, and then what you do is destroy your bacteria, then
you don't enjoy life, other things break down, and then where are you?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You're on
the road to death."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",More degeneration.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you don't panic and know...I've been
doing this for many many many years now."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","On the raw foods and raw meats, the
high bacteria."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When you detox on this diet you detox...

'...reducers, and it worked to get rid of the bacteria, but it didn't really
help me as far as the energy level, I didn't really quite come back out of it, I
was always low-energy, that led to a point at new year's where I'm always dizzy,
couldn't hold urine for more than 15 minutes, very little energy, not clear at
all, couldn't even pick up a job, and when I decided I wanted to live, I ran
into Jill the next day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You turned me onto the book, and we've been a couple of
weeks doing the raw food."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Most of my energy was back.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Within a month, I could
hold my urine all day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And to be honest with you, I've never been able to do
that my whole life."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I always had a problem with that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So something we build
stronger than it was when I was in high school."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I've got muscle all over my
body I've never had, clear, a lot of things."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I have a whole new body in 4
months."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Thank you.'
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","(Clapping)

Most of the time the reactions are not that radical."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Most people do feel
elevated experience once they start the raw meats, however a lot of people will
go into...I'd say about 20% of people go into a detox right away."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Panic.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And
leave the diet."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And never give it a chance.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","All of those who remain on it always
gain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I've got clients who've been on this diet for about 22 years.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","These people
should've been dead ages ago."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And they're still doing it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And they're healthy.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","One man's in his 60s and he had intestinal problems so badly that he basically
was dying."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Just in the stomach, looked like a pear."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He had inflammatory bowel
syndrome."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Went on the diet, got rid of it, his hair was all gray, lost most of
it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When he went onto the diet after about almost 2 years on the diet his hair
came back in and red, and stayed that way for 15 years before it went gray
again."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And still, this man is approaching 70, and he's got the body of a
teenager."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Another case where a fellow had Alzheimers, 67 years old when he went
on the diet."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","His wife put him on it because he really didn't have the faculty to
be able to take care of himself."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So wife put him on the diet, he ate the foods,
thought nothing of it, he didn't have that faculty to discern."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And he ate the
foods, everything she put down, he ate."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Within about 3.5 years he had the body
of a teenager."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I've never seen anybody reverse that quickly.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I don't know if
it's because his mind didn't have all that tension dealing with it, or he had
hormones that occur in young people."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","HGH that usually by the time we're 25 we
don't have any more."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But anyway, when he died 7 years after being on the diet,
he was...he was 67 when he went on it, so he was 75 when he died, somewhere
around there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Did he get his mind back?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, but it didn't get worse."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",His wife never had to hospitalize him.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So
she...Ellie was just elated."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because he was able to stay home with her, and he
was fit, she never had to put diapers on him or anything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So he was in stage 4
Alzheimers."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Stage 1 and 2, I've seen the diet reverse."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But 3 and 4, it stops the
progression of it, but does not reverse it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And balding is the only other one
that I haven't been able to reverse, but maybe 60% of the time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Or the diet, I
don't do anything, the food does it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'm going to take a few minute break just
to have something, do you want to cut that for a minute?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Maybe you're gonna hit the gong one more time.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.

They're eating the hens?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, so through the spinal meningitis I was again detoxing using bath towels,
not as much as that first time, the body will use any avenue it can to secrete
these toxins."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It will go out the skin.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It will be built into the mucous, leave
out the mucous whether it's in the bowels, urinary tract, the sinuses, the
throat, anywhere the poisons can exhude they will excrete."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The vaginal cavity in
women, lots of mucous there, ears can drain, women have basically 7 bowels and
men have 6."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","My theory for women living longer - the main reason is because they
have that extra place to discard, and they discard a lot."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Every period, and also
every day that they're discharging mucous."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",They're getting rid of poisons.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Men
don't have that luxury."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So they contain and hold about 20% more toxins, which
accounts for the 20% of longer life in women than in men."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Also it's 1 in 2 men
that gets cancer and 1 in 3 women that gets cancer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","More data proving that that
theory of mine could be right."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So all of these things that you get, the pain, is
circulation going...nutrients getting into that area, tissue being dissolved,
removed, carted out, new cells being regenerated, all of that is just like you
were to gut a house and re-build it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's not going to be very utilizable during
some of those processes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Like I wasn't able to function at all for days at a
time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","One time it was for 3 days that I really could not do anything but be on
the phone and help other people get well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Here I am crippled and I'm giving
advice on how to get well!"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But the process is, that is the process -
detoxification, and then regeneration following that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When you're decomposing
degenerative tissue in the neurological network, often you'll do them coinciding
together, symbiotically."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You'll regenerate and as you detox.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Otherwise your
whole body could shut down."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now there were times when I couldn't even move, my
lower body, for one time up to 3 days, several times one whole day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Maybe 4
individual days, I could not move."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I mean they just didn't work.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There was no
communication between the brain and the legs and the feet."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I felt like...I was
going like this."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And plus the pain in my back.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I just didn't panic and I knew
that this was a detoxification process, regeneration, and it took from september
to february to april before it concluded."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Driving...

I went up to Sacramento, went up to Mount Chester for a few days, up to
Ashland, drove back down."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","After sitting for a long time, that much driving, I
did have a little bit of tightness and pain in my lower back, but nothing like
during the detox process."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And because I could immediately put myself to the
test, I had more stretchability, more flexibility, than I had in over 33 years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That is how you identify, and you can trust yourself every time you go through a
detox."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Is you wait till several months after your detoxification to see if there
is any improvement in functionality or vitality, or basically your general
better feeling."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You just cannot panic.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You panic, you go to some homeopath who
will give you a remedy, and remember homeopathy is the early stage of allopathy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They give you something that will cause a reaction that's similar to the
symptoms that you're having."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And basically it's fighting fire with fire.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's
causing a trauma and a toxicity, not a nurturing healing effect."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Just like any
drug or medication."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So, taking antibiotics, anything like that, will destroy
that process."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","People who, let's say, have surgeries, like Phil's father just had
a bypass."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",A vowel job.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",As he called it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He's a mechanic, so he calls it a vowel
job."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He takes antibiotics now just so he won't reject and won't have a problem
with that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But he has depression.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Again, you destroy the bacteria, you destroy
the virus, you're gonna have depression."

antibiotics on a regular basis that's a happy person?"

depressed."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Again they destroy the bacteria.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's part of
their life."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Part of giving them life.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I don't know how many ways I can say
it, how many times I can repeat it, detoxification is necessary, healing is
necessary, don't panic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You go through everything that you've ever gone through
in your life, you'll go through it again."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But this time when you go through it
you'll detox properly and you'll heal properly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'll give you another example.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","In my early teens I started having athlete's
foot to the point where I was bleeding."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The only way I could stop it was to take
Listerine and pour it on my feet and let my feet soak in Listerine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",For hours.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And then I could go a few days without the intense itching, causing my body
just...I'd just rip my tissue to pieces and bleed and bleed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, about a week
ago, it started the first time since my teenage years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When I got the cancer and
all of that, of course everything, I had cirrhosis, and bursitis."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So badly that
that was just a part of it, so I didn't identify it differently."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But when I
started doing a raw diet and eating lots of raw fats, all of that subsided, I
very rarely had a problem, except some places where I had impetigo on the face,
those eruptions would come up again and go away."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well this week I started with
the athlete's foot."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",On this foot.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now I think it was this foot reacting that
way, not just because I had had athlete's foot and poisoned it with Listerine,
the great antiseptic, but because in 1980 I was bicycling in the desert on a
street that had moss on it, and I went around a bend, and the tires went out
from under, and this whole foot from here down got caught on the curb, and it
ripped the toes out, one by one."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So it split the toes between the 2nd and 3rd
toe, it split it about 1/2"", the next one about 1"", and the little one split all
the way about 2.5"", to the bone."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It broke 7 bones in my toes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now, I looked at
that, and it's a mess, and I'm in excruciating pain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Luckily the people I was staying with had a 14.5-year old girl, that loved
going around cracking everybody's kunckles."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Was going around...so I waited until
she got up, and I had her put my toes back in place."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","She didn't
dare...she didn't...to let..help me, because look at this mess, all this tissue
hanging, so it took me about an hour to persuade her, literally took an hour to
persuade her to do it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I said 'listen, I'm in pain, you will help me, please
please please', so she did it, and she got the 5 back into place, bones set
right and everything, and there were 2 down here that I didn't know that were
broken, way down there, until the next morning."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I woke up in excruciating pain,
touched around there, and of course they were out of place."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I had to get her
up again, and then have her do it very very hard."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I packed it with mud, in
fact right after she did that I packed it with mud and I hiked 3 miles."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The next
day after she set those other 2 bones, I packed it with clay again and went
bicycling 12 miles."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I knew that if I sat around I was gonna focus on the pain.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I
knew that if I got that foot moving, the circulation would get in there better."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And all of the electromagnetic energy from exercise would make it work quicker.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So I got over all of the pain literally in about a week.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It still took about 10
weeks to heal it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But because I packed all kinds of mud in there and everything,
I'm sure that part of that, and the fungus that remained in that foot from when
I was a young child is coming out now, out of that toe."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's a process.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's a process that everybody will go through, getting rid,
detoxing the things that their body already tried to detox before, but didn't
have the proper nutrients to do it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Just don't panic.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And don't get discouraged,
because a lot of people will get discouraged. '"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Uhh...it's not working, I'm
going...I'm getting sicker, I'm getting ill...I can't move, I'm crippled.'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's just a process.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You'll get

through it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When you get through it, you'll be better."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You just have to be
patient to get to that point where you're better."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And in 100% of the cases, I'm
not exaggerating, 100% of the cases it's always been true."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Whether I've had
cancer...since I wrote the book, I started working with people who had medical
therapies."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Otherwise I stayed away from them because then how can you tell
whether the medical therapy or the diet's working."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So as I said in the book, 98%
of the people who didn't have any therapies with cancer, reversed their cancers."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now I've been working with people who've had therapies, takes about 7 years
before you know...12 years before you absolutely know according to Harven B.
Jones' work, who was professor of medical physics and physiology at Berkeley,
from 30s-40s all the way to the 60s-70s."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","About 60% of them looked like they were
reversing their cancers."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But I really won't know for another 2 years, 4 years, 7
years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Doesn't look as good at all.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","People get better than they were, they start
surviving, all of their nutrient counts go up, their blood normalizes, doctors
are thrilled and all this, but they've been so damaged with chemo and radiation
and surgeries, that their bodies just cannot recover."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I noticed that when
people have these therapies, especially radiation, it destroys virus and
bacteria."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's meant to stop regeneration of anything.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Virus, bacteria,
parasites, anything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I ate pinworm-infested salmon, fluke-infested brain, tripe,
I've eaten a lot of parasites, trying to get them to work in my body when I did
those tests with the animals it showed that they healed...took longer, but they
healed best and got to be like kittens and puppies again, even though they were
very old animals."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Once they got through their parasites.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I tried to introduce
parasites into myself because that was the quickest way."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But they wouldn't take.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Only thing I could theorize was that the chemotherapy still stored in my body
and the radiation therapy has created such a condition where the parasites can't
thrive."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I can use virus and bacteria, so I rot the meats and that works."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But the
parasites, I just can't work with."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There's a Dr. Weinstock, that just released
his information this year, the university of Iowa, that took a flipworm from
pigs, it's a worm that lives in the gut of a pig, and gave it to these people
with inflammatory bowel disease."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What he did was gave them a liquid solution
with...this is sugar water...with the eggs of the flipworm."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He had them drink
it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now what he set out to do is to prove that the flipworm would not be harmful
to these people even though they had inflammatory bowel disease."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What happened
was, that these people got well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",From eating these parasites.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Parasite eggs.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And
they were back 4-5 months later 'can we have some more of those?'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He wasn't
expecting that at all."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Were they on a raw food diet, or...?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, regular diet."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You can take...there's an African medical doctor, he uses
maggots to get rid of gangrene."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","This one woman, National Georgraphic shot it and
put it on TV, on the British broadcasting network, you could see her whole arm
was going to have to be amputated."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It was a mess.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He took maggots, very young
maggots, and then laid a layer of them all over that, wrapped it with gauze,
about 5 layers, and when you could see that some of the maggots were hatching,
he unwrapped it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And this tissue was all clean and new.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No scarring.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Australia
has just made honey a medicine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So the doctors can prescribe honey as medication
for burns."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because it reduces scarring by 80% and increases healing 2-3 times.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Topically?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yup.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There are a few open minds out there in the medical profession, but there
are not many."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Did he mix the honey with anything, or just as it is?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, just as is."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I wouldn't use crystallized, though."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Unheated honey?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Unheated.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Completely unheated.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yea.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Someone asked me about eating a lot of
honey."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I've only found a few people, like maybe 2 out of 200, an average of 2
out of 200, so 1 out of 100 people, still has an allergy to completely unheated
honey."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And it's a temporary thing, usually takes them 3 months to get to the
point where they're not allergic to it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There's no anaphylaxis, I've never seen
anybody have anaphylaxis from it, child or otherwise, from completely unheated
honey, but when the bee goes around collecting the nectar, it swallows it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","In
its stomach it produces an insulin-like substance that converts that
carbohydrate into enzymes, not just protein catalysts as I thought before, but
actual enzymes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Live active enzymes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And those enzymes are utilized for protein
utilization, assimilation, even digestion."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",90% of it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So only 10% is left as a
sugar."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That 1%, 1 out of 100, cannot utilize that insulin-like substance."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It
neutralizes it, so then it refers all that back into a sugar, even though it's
not a radical sugar, it will cause damage, they still can't handle a high level
of sugar."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Just like they can't handle a high level of food, even if it's raw,
because the pancreas doesn't produce insulin properly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Or an insulin that can't
utilize the sugar properly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because some people's pancreases are fine.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They're
manufacturing insulin, but still they have hypoglycemia or diabetic effect,
because the insulin that they're producing is not workable."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's not able to be
utilized properly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I would say 90% of all the diabetics that I've seen were not
even diabetics."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Their pancreases were completely working.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It just may have been
that day, that test that they had, it showed high level of blood sugar, and the
doctor said 'you're diabetic, take insulin.'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",9 out of 10.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Had never been
diabetic in the first place."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Taking it 25-30 years.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Put them on a good diet,
take them off the insulin, they're functioning normally."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Easily.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's a big
racket."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Drug industry loves it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The CEOs love it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Salesmen love it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'm gonna start taking questions now.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The thing with the...I have reactions too when I have honey, so it may
disappear over time, maybe not?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What are your reactions?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well I have...the brightness bothers me and I have muscle pain all over my
body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",All over your body?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Mostly actually the shoulder, the neck, but I'm sore, my muscles are so sore,
what else do I have...blurry vision, sensitivity to bright light, muscle cramp,
that's it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But the thing is, then I get addicted to it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's like I want more.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I
have to just stop."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Well your symptoms are not an allergy to it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Your symptoms are a detox of AGEs.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Remember I said when the body has taken carbohydrates and utilized them as
glycogen or cooked carbohydrates and turned them into AGEs, they store at rate
of 70-90%?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Her body's loaded with them.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Honey helps her clean those out.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And
just like when you're exercising, you have a lot of lactic acid built up the
next day you're sore all over?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The honey's pulling out the AGEs and making them
fluid and they cause the muscles to be sore."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Sometimes tendons.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","With my vision, it's really impairment, because I can't see, I can't read,...

That means that you're...in every situation where I've advised eating lots of
protein when that happens, usually within an hour the vision is restored."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So it
means you need protein immediately."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And not eggs.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You can put egg white in your
eyes and that'll help."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But actually eating meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And beef when you have blurred
vision, for some reason,...not everything is logical."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not everything is linear.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You figure that the eye is mainly neurological tissue and should go along with
all the other reactions that I've had utilizing fish and fowl to regenerate
neurological tissue faster than you can regenerate neurological tissue by eating
lamb or beef or venison, any of those."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","However when it comes to the vision of
they eye, when you start getting blurred vision, it's a low red meat substance
that clears it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So if you start getting blurred vision, you know you need to eat
red meat, real soon."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Right away.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Do you get reports from people on the diet, reports of improved vision in
general, like nearsightedness and...

Yes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The most radical one, there's a doctor in Santa Fe, New Mexico, who is a
psychologist and works for the government."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",She's an expert witness.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","She has had
asthma all of her life."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And the whites of her eyes were always bright red, so it
looked like she was always stoned."

looking like she's stoned on dope."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And how credible is that?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So she'd gone on
the diet and went from using an inhaler every day, anywhere, she said up to 30
times a day, using an inhaler, and on prednisone, all the time, to utilizing
prednisone only 4-5 times a year, 1 day, and her inhaler 4-5 times a year."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And
she had coke-bottle-thick glasses."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","After about 1 year and 3-9 months on the
diet, she called me panicy. '"

eyes!'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I said 'You're 53-54 years old, you've been on a cooked diet for up until
1.5 yrs ago, and it takes 40 years to regenerate everything so the diet's not
going to be able to take care of everything all at once."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So that's something
that may take longer to get to, and also it may get worse before it gets better,
because your body is very depleted and everything, if you've been taking
prednisone, and inhalers all these years.'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But I said 'if you want to find out,
go see the optometrist, and see what he has to say.'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So she went to the
optometrist, called me when she got home, she said 'guess what!"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",guess what!
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","my
eyes got so much better, I had to have the prescription reduced so I could see!'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I have had that reaction only with the people who regularly put once a day, once
every other day, egg white in their eye."

put 1/2 tsp in it, hold your eye open like this, like it's gonna pop out, put
the eyepiece up in there so that the edges hold the eye open."

back, roll it around about 5 times, drop it back in, remove it, open the eye
again, and roll it for about a minute."

massaged into the eye."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It does reverse eye stigmatism, everything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If your eyes
are very bloodshot, it will reverse that within about 20 minutes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You do this every day?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yup, you can do it every day, several times a day, if you like."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",My publiser's girlfriend's father is a painter.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So he's been around
spraypaints...oh my God, so you can see his eyes all the time were bright red."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So about a month ago, publisher called me, and he said 'what can he do?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He's not
gonna eat a raw diet, he's from El Salvador, old-school'."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I said 'well, that
don't say that he won't, just give him this to do, put the egg white, have him
put egg white in his eyes 2-3 times a day.'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Within a week he was eating raw
meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because that worked so well.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And they'd given him drops, they'd done
everything, they said he was gonna lose his eyes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I just saw

him for the first time the day I left."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And his eyes were just as white as
white...he had a little red on this side of one eye, and that was it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And he was
putting the egg white in his eye 3 times a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Is that good for inflammation as well?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Inflammation in the eyes?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yes, like...yea conjunctivitis, pink eye, whatever you want to call it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I've been sick for quite a while...

Congratulations."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","..and I tried...I was diagnosed with parasite, a certain kind of parasite from
Mexico."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I was using herbs and using this and that, and I finally got so
debilitated I decided to use an anti-biotic which I've never done before, which
I'm on right now...but my experience with the parasite...my symptoms from the
parasite are much better and feeling stronger, and my experience is that...I
know that what you're saying is what you're saying, but my experience was that I
probably was...it's not a successful parasite that kills its host, but I think
this parasite and I were not getting along."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Were you eating a raw diet?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, not on this diet, but I've always eaten...I've never eaten raw meat, but I
eat a lot of raw stuff, and juice and stuff, just because that's how I eat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yea, but that won't do it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You gotta have raw fats and raw meat to deal with
degenerative tissue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because that's what they feed on.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They feed on degenerative
cells."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And the only way you can replace and protect cells is with raw fats and
raw meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So the antibiotic will work for you because it'll destroy those that
are feeding on you, if you're not supplying the nutrients."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","People who have
problems with parasites are people who do not eat meats or proteins that will
rebuild and regenerate their cells."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Otherwise they'll ulcerate and have
problems."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you probably had ulcerations all throughout your system, where the
parasites were eating."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And whatever you were eating was not regenerating the
tissue well enough too keep up with the rapidity at which the parasites work,
eat away at that tissue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you have no concern when you buy conventional, or buy beef, or fish, or
whatever, with the parasites that could be in that meat?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, no, no."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not at all.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What about someone who's debilitated, would it be a concern for them?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I give more rotten food to them than I do to anybody else.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Let me ask you another question.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Since I've spoken to Jill, I've been making
clabbered raw goat's milk and putting eggs in."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I can't handle the eggs, I
don't know why, I just don't digest them well, and I like the idea of it, it's
not that I'm resistant to it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do you have people with that problem?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yea, some people can't handle eggs right away."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Especially the egg white.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, it's not the egg white."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's actually the combination, the egg white and
the yolk, that causes the intense detoxifications."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And if you just had...if
you've gone through a series of antibiotics, your digestion...

It was even before that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You tried the eggs?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yea.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I just can't...

But you were taking the herbal dewormers?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not at that point.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's not worms, they're not the big guys."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The big guys I
think are easier to deal with."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They're the microscopic one-cell...

Still flukes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They're not flukes, they're protozoa."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And they actually get into the cell, into
the walls of the intestines and cause diarrhea and that's the main thing...pain,
diarrhea, and gas."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",They're not good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yea they are.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But yours weren't, because you were not eating a diet that
allowed them to do their job properly and you were not able to regenerate and
protect yourself from the byproducts."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The byproducts cause the diarrhea, and
some people bleeding."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When people eat properly, eat lots of raw fats, especially
meats, the fats in meats and dairy fats, they don't have that problem."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Some
people have a problem if they have a digestibility problem."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If they have
intestinal problems, do not handle eggs well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When people eat properly, eat lots
of raw fats, especially meats, the fats in meats and dairy fats, they don't have
that problem."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Some people have a problem if they have a digestibility problem.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If they have intestinal problems, do not handle eggs well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",For a while.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","One time
I saw it take 2.5 years before the person could eat eggs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Then you don't suggest they try the eggs?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, I tell them to stay away from eggs, but maybe couple a week."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's all.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Do you worry at all about the...you probably think it's nuts, but they say that
biotin is bound by egg white...

The spell check when my book was done, and I talk about that in my book, it
substituted the avidin for albumen."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So when you see albumen when I talk about
the biotin and the albumen, that's supposed to be avidin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That happens in a test
tube and not in the human body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not in an animal's body.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And when they check the
feces and find a high rate of avidin and biotin together, it's always in the
accompaniment of biocarbons."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Which is starches?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, biocarbons are when we have used something to utilize it as fuel and
there's carbon left over, those biocarbons, no matter what it is we've used to
burn whether it's carbohydrate or fat or proteins in the form of pyruvate,
there's a carbon left over."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Always those carbons, no matter what they are, are
attached to that avidin and biotin mixture."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So what they've done, is they've
pulled out toxins."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You'll have less of those carbons if you eat raw foods.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You
don't have an overabundance of them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But when you eat cooked foods, you've got a
high rate of them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because again, you go into an AGE that's very similar to the
carbon, and then you'll find it bound in that binding process of the avidin and
biotin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But it doesn't stop it from working.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Means there'll be less biotin for
the brain activity, yes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But there's no ill symptom from it as the conclusion
was formed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Was a very ill-formed conclusion.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Well it's pervasive in the literature.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh yes, definitely."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So one last question, and I know it's hard for you to assess where I'm at since
I'm not doing the full diet, but I have been eating mostly proteins and
vegetables."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I find...

Together?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, I mean in my diet."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But are you eating them together at all?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Are you eating vegetables with meat and vegetable juices with meat?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'm not eating meat at all.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'm eating eggs and dairy mostly.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You should not drink vegetable juice, with any kind of protein."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Vegetable
juice should be had alone or with fat only."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Like raw cream or coconut cream.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If
you combine vegetable juice with milk, where there's protein in it, with any
kind of meat, no matter whether it's seafood, fowl, or red meat, you're going to
have an acid and an alkaline in the stomach at the same time, and they're gonna
neutralize each other, and neither are going to digest."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The only time that I
recommend that they're eaten together is like eggs and milk and vinegar and
cream is when someone gets really backed up, stopped up."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","None of that digests
together."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So it'll just flush right through.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So you don't even combine eggs and milk?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yea, eggs and milk, they're both acids."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And they're both proteins.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Right, they're both acids, so they're great together."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So, what I was getting to, was that it seems like, but I'm not sure that,
because I have such trouble with energy anyway, that I needed some kind of
carbohydrate for energy that I wasn't...

No, you'd be lacking the protein."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","See, the main fuel that's the healthiest
fuel, and that is utilized with the least amount of byproduct is 80% fat, 15%
protein, 5% carbohydrate."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Carbohydrate meaning vegetables?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, well, could be from vegetables, but that doesn't digest well as
carbohydrate, could be fruit, could be the 10% of the honey that you eat, carrot
juice, or something like that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You don't use starches at all?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I recommend starches for people like fighters, who beat their girlfriends
up, beat their wives up."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'd rather it damage them than they damage other
people, because that cooked starch will arrest those excess hormones that cause
them to be so violent."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And that's the only time I recommend it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Like in the book
when you read that I ate the cooked starch when I found out my son was on his
deathbed, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't think properly, or anything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So for the
first time in 13 years, I ate 1/2 baked potato, with a whole stick of butter."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Raw unsalted butter.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So it wouldn't...those AGEs wouldn't end up in my tissues.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But after that I went for nuts, and a nut mixture to take care of that
carbohydrate."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Nuts in the human body will be mainly starch.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So is that good?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because I eat a lot of nuts.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It isn't good unless you mix it in proper form because in any nuts and seeds
and sprouts you have enzyme inactivators."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Protein inhibitors.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Enzyme and protein
inhibitors."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you eat a lot of them, you get still hungry, and you're more
hungry and more hungry, and you can't get satisfied."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you take nuts, take 1/2
cup, better nuts are the softer ones like pine nuts, walnuts, pecans."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Take 1/2
cup."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Blend them into a powder.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Add 3 oz of either raw cream, you can have up to
4oz, but if you're using the spectrum natural peanut oil which is pressed below
92 deg, use 3oz of that, one of these fats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Coconut cream, peanut oil, regular
cream, butter."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So it's...if you wanted to use 8tbsp of butter, that's fine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","2tbsp of honey, unheated honey."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And blend that together.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now the combination of
those oils and with the honey will neutralize those enzyme and protein
inhibitors."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you eat the nuts by themselves or just with honey, you will
bloat, and you'll stop digestion of certain things."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And you'll inhibit the
activity of the pancreas."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Which has to supply the enzymes if they're missing.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Or
the pancreas has to take the enzymes that are in food, re-work them, which is
normal, into enzymes which are utilized in the human body and send them back
into the stomach and liver."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's a normal process.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you're eating cooked
foods, the pancreas has to send out hormones to pull out, leech from your body,
enzymes, vitamins, minerals, that's part of your natural constituency, and it's
robbing from Peter to pay Paul."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",We've got a lot of people here so I'm going to get started.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Anybody who has to
leave early?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because this'll be about 10 minutes per person, maybe only 5, but
depending, so you have to go early?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You have to?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Who else?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Does anybody have to
leave early?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Let's say, do you have about 1.5 hrs, 2 hrs?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So just one gentleman,
let's start with you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What's your name?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Doug.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Doug, come on up Doug."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Come on up, the price is right!"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","We're going to
have to open this up a little bit because the light's...because of the glum day,
I have to look over here."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If he have to resort to that, we will."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Face this
way."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There we go, good."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay Doug, you have very overactive sex glands, so if
you don't have a partner, take care of yourself."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because that can make you
irritable."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Very heavy overactive adrenal glands.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Pancreas is overactive too, but
it's debilitating, it's probably about 40% active."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Lots of swelling.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",In the pancreas?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",In the pancreas.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's mainly edema, not much fat in it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The left thyroid gland
is okay, the parathyroids are overactive, the lymph glands in the throat are
pretty good, did you have your tonsils removed?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It looks like you may have grown the left one back a little bit.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Tonsils and adenoids.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yea.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Looks like a little bit has grown back over here, here it's completely
flat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Parathyroids overactive on the right side too, the thyroid's low."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","RBC
count is good, you're not utilizing fats properly, so you've got a lot of
clogging in the liver, in the kidneys."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","In the small intestine, a little bit in
the spine, in the center."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Looks like you're starting to...the adrenaline is
starting to store at a rapid rate in drying out tissue...looks like you're on
the road to ezcema or cirrhosis."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You need to eat lots of fats, about 50-55% red
meat, meaning beef, lamb, buffalo, venison."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If I talk about red meat, I'm
talking about that variety, not like salmon or tuna."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's seafood.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's
white meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And then the other...you need about 10% fish (seafood) and 25-30%
fowl."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That'll help your skin and lymph system get back together.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You're just not
utilizing fats very well any more."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do you exercise?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",A little.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not a lot.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because these overactive adrenals, and those overactive testes, that's a lot of
hormones that'll make you, if you don't do it, you're going to be irritable."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So I should exercise?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yea.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Unless you want to take it out on other people.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You can be irritable.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You
have very good regenerative abilities, once you start eating lots of raw meat
and raw fats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You'll go fast.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I suggest you eat about 8-10 eggs a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Raw?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yea.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And I would have maybe 4-6 of them Rocky-style.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Just down them without
whipping them up."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And that'll be easier to eat, and you'll be able to eat more
of them that way."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The others you can have with milk, if you can get the milk."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because you have these skin conditions, you know a lot of people, if you listen
to these, you will get a lot of information out of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because you have some
skin conditions, I suggest that you do not have eggs and fruit together."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because
it'll be made into a solvent, you're already too dry right now."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You want to
lubricate your system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Before you go making solvents.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Your body will make what
it needs to when it needs to but if you mix fruit with eggs it's going to be
made into a solvent."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Toxic body?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well you've got lots of toxins, but they're all...most of the toxins are
fat-bound."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But you have no fat left to lubricate your system, it's already bound
in toxins."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you need to go on a detox program, and I'm gonna take a few
minutes right after I finish him to give everybody some basic detox regimes so
that you can detox easier."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","One fruit I recommend you have to break up some of
that fat and eliminate it, is a little pineapple once in a while."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And if you're
going to eat fruit, no more than 1 piece a day with some kind of fat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Coconut
cream, raw cream, milk, cheese, something like that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Do you have any
questions?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Good things.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",One thing I didn't know is the parathyroid.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Everything else you've
nailed right on."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",All right.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, what I like people to do, as part of the detox process, I like
them to get fat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Gain weight.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Gain anywhere from 12 lbs minimum overweight to
30lbs overweight."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",12-30lbs over what you should weigh.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now the reason for that
is, those fats, like I said, your body will use them as solvents and for binding
with toxicity."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So as those toxins that are stored deeply in you are pulled out,
with the solvents, the fats can bind with them again and then it's like old oil
in a car."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You put the new oil in, it takes the carbons, the shavings, it gets
thick and black and you need to change the oil."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You cannot remove old deep
storages without this process."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I tried for years.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",About 11 or 12 years.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And the
only way people can do it is by gaining that much weight."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now there's some
people who will do it in a 3-month cycle, 3 months gaining, 3 months losing, one
girl does it in a 6 week cycle."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Gains it in 6 weeks, about 15 lbs, and loses it
in 6 weeks."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",6-8 weeks.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Her body has cleaned faster than I've ever seen anybody.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Her eyes went from dark brown to green in a matter of 2.5 years.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I've never seen
anybody's go from dark brown to that much clearer of a color in only 2.5 years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",She's diligent about it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What if you're overweight already?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, what I usually suggest for that is, you just eat the raw foods to
stabilize yourself for about 8-10 weeks, and then you go take it off."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And then
once you take it off, then you start putting it back on."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",First you lose weight then you gain?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, first you just stay where you are for about 8-10 weeks."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And then you take
it off."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now to put it on, milk and eggs together, lots of eggs, eggs and meat
together, fat with everything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That'll help you put it on.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That'll stabilize
your system, relax your nervous system, stabilize your nervous system, your
brain function, everything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And when you detox, there are several methods."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But
basically what you do is, one day you'll drink a cup of vegetable juice, when
you're very hungry, 1 egg, when you're very hungry, another cup of vegetable
juice, when you're very hungry, another egg."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So what you're doing is egg, juice,
egg, juice, etc, until you go to sleep."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But you always wait until you're very
hungry."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The next day, you have the same thing, only instead of egg you have an
egg-sized amount of meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You can have the meat with a sauce if you want.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Like a
salsa, which doesn't have fat in it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Blend tomato and onion, maybe 1/4 tsp of
lemon juice in that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Mustard?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Are we all going to have recordings of this whole...

If you buy them from him, yea."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So we don't have to worry about...

Yeah, right."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So that way it's juice, meat, juice, meat, etc, all day long."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But
you always wait until you're very hungry."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Don't wait till you're so hungry that
your brain stops working."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Cause that can happen.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And don't wait till you're so
hungry that you're shaking."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Just wait till you're very hungry in the stomach,
not in body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Sometimes you can not be hungry in the stomach, and be too hungry
in body, don't wait to be hungry in stomach then."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",If you start shaking.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That
means you're getting dangerously low in protein."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Dangerously low means that if
you stand too quickly you can pass out and hurt yourself."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","For some people, I
will tell them to have 2 days of meat in a row, 1 day of egg, 2 days meat, 1 day
egg, etc."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If somebody's very thin, I will tell them to do the opposite."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","2 days
egg, 1 day meat, 2 days egg, 1 day meat, etc."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Sometimes if you're very
overweight, I'll say go 3 days meat, 1 day egg, 3 days meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you do this for a week, or...?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You do this 6-8 weeks, however long it takes you to take off the weight."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And you're taking weight off?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yea, if you're on that...this is the detox program."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Everybody's supposed to
gain the weight, and this is how to take it off."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So when you get up to, 12-30lbs
overweight, then it's time to take it off."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What about the people who cannot gain weight?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I don't know.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I try, but...

Well, you're combining a few bad things."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Which may prevent you from doing it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You've discovered today you combine a few...you don't remember?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yea you're
having lemon with the nuts, lime...

That's anger remedy, I don't do that very often."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's the anger remedy, yes, that is good that nut thing is good for an anger
remedy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But do not put lemon or lime juice in it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Cause that will completely
stop the digestion of the nuts."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And then you will have all these undigested
proteins floating in you blood."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And that will cause allergies.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","This put on weight, take off weight, however many weeks it takes you to get to
a weight that you feel you've put on weight and then you take off that, and
whether it's 2 weeks or 2 years, you go to the cycle again to a low point and
keep taking it from a high point to a low point?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, I've been doing it for 20 years, 17 years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I've only been eating a diet
of meat on a daily basis for 17 years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","My 6.5 years of raw food fruitarianism,
veganism, I don't even count."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because there was no protein to build my system.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I
give it 3, maybe 3 years if also I take the years from 76 when I started eating
meat, to 82 when I started eating meat on a daily basis, there is about 5 years
there that...about 6 years, I still only count 3 years with all of that 10-year
period."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Cause I was not eating meat every day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I'm basically only half way,
20 years in."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","To being, toward my optimum, I'm half way."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'm already satisfied, I
mean if I stopped right here, it'd be okay."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But I know that I still have a lot
to go."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","In my irises I can see the scar tissue that still remains in my spine,
all my abdominal area and in my brain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",65% of my brain is scar tissue.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's
why I'm such an idiot."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","We only use 5% of our brains for neurological thought
processes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The rest is a garbage dump.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Man is the only one who cooks his food
and man is the only one who has a big brain, that mainly in everybody's eyes
comes out to be at least 60% toxic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I met a girl, new client, about 2 weeks ago,
that only had 40% toxic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I was amazed.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But most brains are just toxic dump
sites."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And probably that's why the brain got so big.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Cause man's been cooking a
long time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","In fact there was a scientist that came up with: 2 million years ago
man's brain was this size and basically they also found that he cooked some of
his foods."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That may have been the start of it, who knows."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's just theory.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, so you know to put in on, take it off, put it on, and take it off."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's
a process, it'll help you get through your stuff easier, you'll have less flus
and colds, and if you have them, they will be less virulent."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What foods keep somebody from gaining weight?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Pineapple.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",This man eats a whole pineapple a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh, wow."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Usually when I have other clients that are as thin as he is doing that, they
become so emotional and so irritable, they are unbearable."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I usually say
'stay off it if you're that thin, have pineapple just once in a while.'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I
suggest that most people do not eat much fruit at all."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I only eat fruit maybe
once every 3-4, sometimes 5 days."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And a lot of times I'll go for tomato,
something that doesn't have a lot of carbohydrate in it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Remember that fruit
will make you emotional."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Very true.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you have...are very weepy, and feeling sorry for yourself, stay off of
fruit, stay away from it like the plague for about 5 days, and you'll come out
of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you want to speed it up, rot some meat and eat that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","In place of your
fruit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And you'll be out of your depression quickly.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Can you eat too many eggs?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","For you, no."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Some people, yes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","How about too much meat, too much proteins?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's all individual.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But for you I would say there's no way you could eat too
much of anything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Especially if you're eating a pineapple a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I could eat 2.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And you also eat tons more food, too."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So remember that fruit only needs to be
5% of your diet at most."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The body utilizes fat, mainly fat for everything, it's
a solvent, to stabilize your body, and to give you energy, 80% is fat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","15%
protein."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",5% carbohydrates.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The carbohydrate doesn't have to come in the form of
fruit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Say I eat 1 piece of fruit every 4-5 days.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That'll total up 5% of my
need."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I need to stay away from it because I was diabetic and my pancreas really
hasn't healed much, maybe 10%."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So I don't handle fruit well.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Doesn't the brain run on glucose?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yea, but your body can make glucose from proteins, even."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Pyruvate.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Isn't it the harder way?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Most of your animals in nature don't eat much fruit.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Except for the bats
and some of the monkeys."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But those monkeys are hyperactive and crazy.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It was nominated for an academy award and
won it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And he showed that if you took monkeys and apes and in their natural
environment they never ate ripe fruit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Never ever ever.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They always ate it
green, or there was hardly any sugar in it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Green bananas, green figs,
everything was green that they ate."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When they took ripe bananas and they took 3
bunches of them and threw them in the midst of these apes, now the apes normally
would go up, pull a banana off, and that's it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But they were thrown out these
bananas, the apes started eating the ripe, they had never done that before."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Started eating them ripe.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","within 1/2 hour, they were all fighting over them, and
they couldn't stop eating them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And they were fighting each other, they were
screaming, they were hitting, and they weren't like that before."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So fruit, you
should be careful with."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not the great carbohydrate to use.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You have the nuts,
you have carbohydrate in everything, even in meat there's carbohydrate."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Can you talk a little bit about berries?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Berries I use for detoxification of toxic minerals in the system.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And also to
get rid of mutant antibodies from vaccines or antibiotics."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you'll take
berries, and then you take the juice and put it on metal, you'll see it turn
black, and the metal come right up and off that container."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you have one of
those canning jars with the lid, and you get berry juice on it, with the pulp on
it, it will just turn black and come up off."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And you've ruined the lining of
that lid, throw it away, get another."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's what happens in the body.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I use
them to help pull out lots of toxic minerals."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The most toxic alternative therapy
I've ever seen in my life is chelation therapy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And people who take colloidal
silver and colloidal minerals."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It poisons the system.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They say it pulls out
toxic minerals, like lead, mercury, and stuff like that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It may pull it out.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But
it's also, those things are full of metals already."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's what they are.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And in
a solution that's very fine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So what happens, it lodges in both the bones and
the lymph."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I've seen people turn their systems completely toxic from one bottle
of colloidal silver."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And cause chronic fatigue for up to 7 years, to get rid of
it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So, anybody you hear say 'colloidal silver, colloidal minerals, chelation
therapy', I hope the hair on you back bristles up."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And tell them not to.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",... as well?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yup.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Can't be utilized, it's impossible."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you go out and feed it to one of
these trees or plants, a plant is geared up to take those inorganic minerals,
and to make them organic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And then an animal eats the plant, and then certain
animals eat the animals."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",To get those nutrients.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But we are not plants.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","We
cannot utilize those minerals, they are toxic to us."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Poisonous to us.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What about supplements?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Same thing with supplements.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But mineral supplements are usually bound in some
kind of a starch or some binder, in a capsule or a pill, so usually they don't
even get absorbed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You're just paying a lot of money for placebo, basically."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","All
supplements are only 2-12% utilizable."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Means you're spending a lot of money for
nothing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The rest, the 82-92% that is toxic, is toxic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Non-digestible, and will
cause toxicity, your body has to remove it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Has to use good nutrients to get rid
of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So, supplements maybe helpful to people who predominantly eat cooked
foods."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Let's say 80% cooked foods.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Supplements might be helpful for them.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","In
some circumstances."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But mostly they're toxic, if you're eating any more raw
foods than that, they will be more toxic than not."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Unless you are deficient in
one particular substance that's the straw that breaks the camel's back."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Causes
your problem."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Then that one particular substance that you may get, only 2-12%
utilizable, may be just enough for you to come out of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But that's not the way
to do it permanently."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Cause there will be side effects.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Sulfur is what binds to toxins for detoxing?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The mineral sulfur is good to detoxify bones?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well if you want to have...when I
did experiments with that over a long period, it's not new, it's just now
marketed well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Sulfur drugs cause all kinds of skin lesions.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Burns.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I wasn't thinking about drugs so much.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Maybe sulfur food...

Well, sulfur food is eggs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Eggs and milk are very high in sulfur.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",MSM is good?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",All those things are poisonous.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You've heard about the people who
spontaneously combust?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Anybody heard about those people?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Everyone that
interviewed took sulfur drugs for kidney problems or bladder problems."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When that
mixes with certain people, that sulfur mixes with body chemicals, and when it
comes out through the skin and hits the oxygen, it causes spontaneous eruptions."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",People have burns all the time.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","All of a sudden something that'll look like
they've been burned."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's sulfur drug coming out through the skin, having a
toxic reaction."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The one woman that I interviewed, where 2/3 of her body, she was
in a trailer, sitting down drinking coffee, and her body went up in flames, 2/3
of her body was burned, she took sulfur drugs for 22 years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And in her burned
tissue, guess what was high in there?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Burned sulfur.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Gee, now why doesn't the
medical profession come out with that information, why didn't the news cover?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","This woman's body, her skin had high sulfur in it, because she took high sulfur
drugs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",They don't tell you that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Any of these supplements that you take, when
they're inorganic and not in a food form, are not going to be utilized properly,
and they're gonna cake in your system like plaster."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And if your body tries to
pull it out with a solvent, which has maybe the turpentine reaction after that,
then you're coming up with some dangerous chemical reactions."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And if it's
exposed to oxygen when it comes through the skin, or out the nasal passages, or
causing skin cancer, there are all kinds of side effects from it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","This is all
about marketing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Did you notice that the medical profession and pharmaceutical
community have adopted all these vitamins and supplements now?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because they are
more drugs they can sell."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's why they got into it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","20 years ago they were
fighting them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because they didn't have a market on them.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They weren't selling
them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now that they're selling them, they want you to buy them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, let's take
the next person."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Shall we just go around the line, or do you want to...

She has to leave first."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yes?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What's your name?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Marcy

Okay Marcy, you have very overactive sex glands, your adrenal glands are
normal, your pancreas, almost looks non-existent, so looks like you have a
diabetic nature."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Doesn't look like you produce much insulin at all.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Thyroid's in
very good condition, parathyroids are overactive, looks like you had a
tonsillectomy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I did.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The lymph glands in your throat on the right side are very congested.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Throughout the entire neck area.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And even in the chest area, a little bit,
especially on the left side."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Poor circulation everywhere.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Your RBCs don't
transport oxygen very well, you need about 60-65% red meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And about 35-40%
white meat, and other than that, I would say 10% or a little bit higher should
be seafood."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I would vary it, sometimes I'd eat more fish and less fowl."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You have
indications of very low self-esteem."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So you need to be very creative.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I don't
know if you've healed from that or not."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I am trying to get my creativity back, that's one of my big issues, and I've
been low-energy, and I haven't been painting."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, it could be writing, it could be anything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","While you're in this fatigue,
you still need to be creative because your self-esteem is based in there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So
writing, whether it's poetry, music, or prose, whatever it is."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Will help you
there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You have a lot of bruising.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Were you a big salt eater?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Not particularly, no."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You mean when you bang...then have a bruise...Yea, I do
that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Not high in adrenaline, and not much salt,...did you still use salt a little
bit?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Cause you just could be allergic to it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Hardly ever, I used any extra salt."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's in a lot of foods that are hidden like breads, soy sauce,...

Yea, I don't use much soy sauce, either."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Could be hidden other places.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What kind of paint do you use?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When I am painting, oil paint."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Oil?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It could be mineral toxicity from that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You know the cadmium, in the
yellow, the cobalt in the blue, what I recommend that you do is put olive oil on
your hands, all the way up to your wrists, so it doesn't absorb into your hands."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because it looks like actually a poisoning.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Salt can do that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And it's causing
bruised tissue all over."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's causing like a degeneration of the blood veins.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I've always had a very low immune system since I was a baby, and catching
pneumonia, and heavy flus, that would go for months, things like that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I don't
know if it plays into this bruising business or not."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well you could have gotten some kind of medication at a very young age which
caused the damage."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Tons of antibiotics.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Gonna recommend that you drink 1/2 cup of white or green cabbage, whatever you
want to call it, not the red cabbage, the white cabbage."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","For about 1/2 cup every
other day for about 6 weeks."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",To help stabilize that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because it looks like
there's hemorrhaging in your blood vessels here and there, some ulcerations, and
the vitamin K and the vitamin U in the cabbage will help balance that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Stabilize
that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You need to eat lots of ripe meat, you have very little bacteria in your
system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",In your torso.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You do have the bacteria in your extremities, you have
molds."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But none in your torso.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And you have them in your brain, but it's just in
your torso, you hardly have any bacteria."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I guess that's from taking the
antibiotics."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Your body protected your limbs from it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But not your torso.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Basically I would only eat fruit when you absolutely feel you have to.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'm not much of a fruit eater.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Like me maybe, once every 4-5 days, and always eat it with some kind of fat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","How about...I have done smoothies since I read your book, fruit juice with egg,
blended up."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Even in my book I say do not use fruit juice.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I make my own.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Even if you juice it, you're supposed to use the whole fruit, if you're
blending it with eggs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I suggest that you have milk, honey, and eggs together."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Mainly.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Keep the fruit
down, way down."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Otherwise, with this kind of condition, you'll get very
emotional and very depressed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",From fruit.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Of course if you go 5-6 days without
it, then you might get depressed for the same reason."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That you're not burning
your fats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do you exercise?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Occasionally.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'm trying to do more.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Well I suggest that you mainly walk.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Do a little walking every day, at least 5
days a week, and that'll help."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Your circulation is really damaged from the lack
of bacteria."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And then your bronchials and your lungs, looks like you have some
scar tissue there, pretty heavy scarring in your lungs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Were you a smoker?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I had been for a while, and I almost died in pneumonia when I was 4, so that
was...

...a deterrent to smoking, but you smoked anyway?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","This kind of scarring in the
lungs means that you're going to go through pneumonia a couple of times."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","To
clean it out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Rejoice, have a party."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Be happy, because that's about the only way
you're going to break up that kind of scarring, it's mainly in the left lung and
bronchials."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Very creative bone there, so you just have to keep creative."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yea, that I know."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And, pretty head strong, you have to have things your way, so if you're going
to have a mate, pick one that likes doing what you like doing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I have a question.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Do you consider when you say not to eat fruit, the half of a
lemon in a lubrication formula, is that separate from other fruit?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yes, definitely."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Those formulas are set.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Any additional fruit is what I'm
talking about."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, would you like to come up?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Well we've got somebody napping out here.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Are avocados fruits?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When I'm talking about fruits, I'm talking about fruits with high carbohydrate
value."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Fruit sugars.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They are are fruit, but they're a bland fruit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","High-fat
bland fruit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Are those okay to have?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Most people do not have a liver that digests it properly - avocados.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I tell
people, wait about 2 years after they've been on the diet before they eat many
avocados."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Other than that, maybe 1-3 per week at the most."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Unless you have no
other fat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Carol

Hi, Carol."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, the right ovary is fine, it's overactive, good and strong,
starting to debilitate a bit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The left ovary is almost 50% debilitated.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Doesn't
look like it's producing at all."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The adrenal glands used to be very overactive,
they're a little fatigued now."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The right side of the pancreas is almost
completely debilitated, the left is about 40% debilitated, and it's edemic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Which means it's retaining a lot of water, it's swollen."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you shouldn't use
many sugars either, fruits."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Keep the fruits down to maybe 1 every other day, and
always eat it with fat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Circulation in your spine is good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",On both sides.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There's hemorraging there, so you have a little bit of hemorraging all over in
you body too."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I'm going to suggest that you also have about 4oz of cabbage
juice every 3 days for you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I forgot on those other 2 people that I read I
recommend 4 cups of vegetable juice a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And usually I give the amounts.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And
it's usually 80% celery and 20% parsley."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Unless I suggest something else.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And do
not have vegetable juice with any foods other than fats - coconut cream, cream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","In the groin area, looks like a tendency toward constipation."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Poor circulation
in that area."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The extremities – good circulation there.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But not in the torso
and down in the groin area."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Red meat should be 60%.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",White meat 40%.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","20% of that
40% should be seafood."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You may increase that at times when you don't have an
appetite for fowl."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There's a lot of congestion in the small intestines, it looks
like the suet that normally is around the kidneys is not breaking down properly
and it's filling with ammonia and it's sending it out to the intestines,
blocking the small intestines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Thyroid is whole, just not functioning well,
parathyroids are whole, functioning better, but not as well as they should be,
do you have your tonsils?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Say 'ah'.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Put your tongue down.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You have some swollen glands here, almost looks
like your tonsils re-grew...The right parathyroid is very overactive and fine,
and the right thyroid is in pretty good shape."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The left side - all of the
glands on the left side are really low."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And breaking down and deteriorating.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So
it's half of your glandular system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not functioning like it should.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's odd
because the circulation on this side is better, yet the glands are debilitated."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And here the circulation is poor but the glands are stable.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So it's your
particular way of balancing it yourself."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because of this configuration, there's
a tendency to be ultra-critical."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You're right for you.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Just know that, you're
right for you and everybody else is right for them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And then there'll be less
conflict."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Very philosophical.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Enjoy that, but again it's all theoretical stuff."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",All that criticism makes your low esteem hit bottom too.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So be creative and then
that'll pull you out of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because that's where your only enjoyment will be
found, is in your creativity."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I usually stay just into the nutritional and
physiological properties, except when I see that mental properties will
interfere with the healing process."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You need to write out some of your
philosophies."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because some of those that you've created are very debilitating to
you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So I would just open up a little bit more some of those philosophies.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Also
your liver's not working very well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So you're storing bile all over your body.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And that will cause sores and irritability and breaking down of bacteria.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because bile will destroy bacteria.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And it'll also cause jaundice all over your
body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I had jaundice when I was a child.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And it never has re...

...raw ripe meats,...and a little,...take an 8oz canning jar, and let some...in
one jar, some chicken, and in another jar, some beef, and in another jar, some
fish."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because you have toxic minerals in your system too, that are interfering
with that, use swordfish for one of them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So you have 3 separate jars.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And you
have maybe 3 oz of each."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Go outside, open it up to the air, 2 days a week, just
open it, close it right back up, and take it in the house, put it in the
refrigerator."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","At 3 weeks, start taking it, and taking it up till it's all gone."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But only take 1 large marble sized amount of each a week, and rotate each week a
different one."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Is that in the book?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, no, my publisher would not let me put certain things in."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's for another
book."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Thank you very much.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You're very welcome.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yes!
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That one I got away with.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What else didn't get in the book?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",A LOT.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",2 books worth of material.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How do you know if you can eat avocados or not?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well normally I can't tell unless I'm looking in the iris and blow it up, so I
would say that if you eat an avocado and it sits a little heavily in your
stomach for about 15 minutes afterwards, you don't digest it well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Of course if
you eat it with something like pineapple, you'll never know the difference."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Ha
ha ha."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Cause there's so much Bromelain in the pineapple, that it'll just melt
it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Would papaya have the same effect?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, it doesn't have the intensity and the citric acid to help break down the
fats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Very different.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Papaya and pineapple.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Let's say if after eating the
avocado you get a little lethargy, you get a little sleepy, it's a sign you're
not digesting it well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I feel like that with what I just ate...

Well probably because you ate so much cheese with it, I would have said just
the reverse - more meat, less cheese."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yea, because you're so enzyme-deficient."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Cheese doesn't have a lot of enzymes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I would say eat some honey, just little
bits of honey just to get the enzymes in there so you can utilize it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's
better when you're first starting out like that, to eat the meat with just very
very little cheese."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And then you'll probably have no trouble at all.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Did you
drink anything, have anything with it other than the cheese and meat?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Water?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Never EVER EVER drink water with meat and cheese.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It will completely dilute your
acids."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And then that stuff will sit in your stomach for quite a while.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","At least
40-50 minutes, and usually meat and cheese should be gone out of the stomach in
20 minutes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Not just water but any...

You should not drink water with any food."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But other fluids?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well you can drink milk with almost anything, except your vegetable juice."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How long after a vegetable juice can you drink milk?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","After the first time, let's say you have vegetable juice the first thing in the
morning, which I usually recommend to get everybody's enzymes going for the day,
wait about 20-40 minutes, that's all."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","After that, it should be an hour either
side."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",For any food.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Before or after vegetable juice.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",An hour.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Just to be on the
safe side."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You recommend the high meat for everyone?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, because some people may have such a violent reaction from it, may put them
into such a heavy detox, that I may not."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Would someone who's relatively healthy with no specific symptom, just a
maintenance dosage?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Absolutely, I would say anybody wants to eat rotten meat on a regular basis
every week, go for it!"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You'll get better faster.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The Eskimos, they would do it
every summer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Getting ready for fall and winter.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's where I was introduced
to it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They took caribou and beat it into a mince, rolled it in whale and seal
blubber, wrapped it in a hide, and buried it in the ground."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It was never deeper
than 6"", under the ground, and never 2"" above the surface."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So it was right in
that 4"" plane."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Between 2"" and 6"" under the ground."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And they let it rot until it
smelled for 1/2 mile downwind, and then it was ready."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And man did it stink.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I
couldn't get within 5 feet of the stench of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I just wanted to barf.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I took
cotton balls with musk oil, stuffed them in my nostrils, and then they shaved
about a golfball size amount off, I went and stuck it and swallowed it quickly,
so that I could get it down, and then ran again away from it, pulled the stuff
out of my nose."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It was okay, but you know I had blood and bone cancers, so I was
always plagued with a cold."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If it got 72 deg, I was already in pain in my
joints."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So after I ate that high meat, and I didn't know it was high meat,
because it was green and black, I thought that it was herbs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Rotten.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I was a
vegetarian at the time, and they were trying to get me to eat raw meat, I
wouldn't do it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But they got me to eat this, because they made me believe, or I
interpreted right away, that it was some herb."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I ate this stuff, and for the
first time ever that I could remember, I was not cold and I was in Alaska."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Sure
it was late summer, it was September, but it was still already cold, in Alaska
it's already snowing in September."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Heavily snowing.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I was not cold for the
entire time I was there for the month, into October."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So they ate massive amounts
of this."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The kids come over, and this fish that you just would not believe that
people would eat, these kids got smiles from ear to ear and they're just eating
it as if it were a lollipop."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Just on a regular basis when you buy meat that's gonna be 2 or 3 days before
you eat it, do you refrigerate it, or leave it out?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I usually refrigerate it, but for the day that I eat it, I usually leave it
out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Cause I like it room temperature.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Tastier that way.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But you could leave it out for 2,3,4 days?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yes, Owanza who I talk about in the book, who had 63 tumors, took her about 11
years to recover from all that, she did something that even the Eskimos didn't
do."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","She took 1 cup of meat, and she let it rot on the kitchen counter for 6
weeks in her apartment."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Open container with nothing but cheesecloth over it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It
stunk up the whole building."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I mean this is in Beverly Hills.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And this apartment
building, there were 8 apartments in this building."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And the 5th week I walked
into the hallway, and I could smell it in the hallway and I was getting a
headache."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So I wouldn't even go into her apartment the last week.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It was that
bad."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It didn't ...?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, it didn't."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","In fact she healed, in the next 18 months, healed quicker than
I've seen her heal in the previous 6.5 years before she did that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There was
worms in it, there were flies in it, she ate everything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","She ate everything that
was in it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Every bit of it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I don't even know how she did it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Probably because
she lived with it every day, and the smell, she was living with it, I don't
know."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","She was braver than I. But she did, and she got much better after that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I
mean she was always in depression."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And after she had that, she was not depressed
again."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not known her to be depressed since that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now she didn't eat it all at
once, it took her about 3 days to eat it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",She did.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How much did she rot?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",About a cup.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","She had one of those wide-mouth ...type jars, with metal flip
lids."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And just put gauze cloth over that with a rubber band around it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I don't
know what it prevented from getting in there, because it was all in there
anyway."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Flies and everything.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Little bitty flies.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Why do you put it in the fridge, why not just leave it outside?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because your whole house will stink.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Even if it's closed?

about 22 years ago."

prime candidate for herpes and candida."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I used to have it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Stronger when I was 20.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You still have it, it's just that you're not detoxing it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Stand by when you
detox it."

around in this area, you're gonna turn green and orange when it starts coming
out."

can handle fruit sugars, you're just so thin, you lack proper fats all over, and
you've got all this bile in there."

you very irritable."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","...

Yea, so I would stay away from fruit for that reason."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you can get raw cream,
and you can have a cup of cream, whole cup of cream with some fruit, you can
probably get away with it."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You're using fragrant oils?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's starting to deteriorate your brain cells.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I would...wear a charcoal
mask, something to stop those vapors."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Is it essential oils are fragrances?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Cause we've always been doing essential
oils and we just switched to fragrances."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That also
adds to your irritability."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because it's damaging those nerve cells.

away from oils."

they're actually eating away the nerve tissue."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Up to 12 eggs a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Cream if you can get it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I
mean, do like I do, get some extra quarts of milk, and suck the cream off, and
use the skim milk for a bath."

red meat, at another time."

milk and a couple of eggs at another time."

matter whether it's hepatitis or not, that's just severe liver damage."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'm gonna
suggest that you have liver at least 2 times a week."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I have liver, when I take
liver, I like pate, I'll just put it in a food processor with some red onion,
and blend it into a pate."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I came up with a new recipe
last week, when I was eating a lot of new buffalo glands."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Or just earlier this
week."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And I make a salsa with cherry tomatoes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Take 5 cherry tomatoes, one
little sliver section of red onion, about 1"" by 0.25"", 1/4 tsp vinegar, blend
that together, and then I'll take 1tsp of that and put it with liver or lungs or
anything, 1/2 cup each, milk, gland, and 1tsp of that salsa, and just a little
bit of garlic, a little sliver of garlic in that, blend that and the salsa, take
a tsp of the salsa and put that in with the milk and the

glands, and blend that together, it tastes like an incredible soup."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And that's
an easy way to eat glandular tissue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you have a particular glandular problem
and you need to bring the gland back quicker, good fresh gland will get it back."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's the only thing I found that helps the glands grow back quickly, or the same
glands that you're having a problem with."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Old is better than fresh?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well to degenerate the old tissue in it, the toxic tissue, the rotted is
better."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But to re-build it, it has to be the fresh."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So remember that a rotted
food will help...

Let me finish this and I'll do that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The thyroid gland is almost
non-functional."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Both sides.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The parathyroids are very overactive trying to make
up for the inactivity of the thyroid gland."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So if you can get thyroid, who was
it?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Can you get thyroid from the deer?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Where is it located?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Throat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You two live near each other?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Easy, you got a source!"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You get that thyroid.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you take that, and some milk,
and some red onion, and blend it together, it'll taste like clam chowder."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But if
you like the salsy tomato-like Mexican flavor, then go with the salsa in with
it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you need liver, you need the thyroid gland, and predominantly...this is a
confusing one, because you're over-acidic, so normally for over-acidic people I
say less meat, because that has a tendency to make you irritable."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you're one
of those people who needs a lot of red meat, but you will get irritable."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you
have to stay on top of your juice, vegetable juice."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You have vegetable juice,
meat, smoothie, vegetable juice, meat, smoothie, vegetable juice, meat,
vegetable juice."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Make sure you get the 4 in, because you have to keep your
system alkaline or you'll get irritable very easily."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And if you go off that
juice, even for 2 days in a row, you'll know it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And you won't be able to eat
the meat, you'll get anorexic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And if you eat too much fruit, you're not gonna
have an appetite for meat, the more fruit you eat, the less you'll be able to
digest meat because it overalkalinizes the intestines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Sweet fruit.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I would
say, I would wait about 3 months before you eat some rotten meat, just to
stabilize."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because you start breaking down some of that liver tissue right now,
and you'll go into fatigue pretty heavily."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So wait about 3 months till you've
gotten good and stable before you start eating rotten meat, and you do need some
rotten meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Cause that is...a lot of your depression.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And the recipes for juices and smoothies are in the back of that book?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, yours should be 80% celery and 20% parsley."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Everybody is 80% celery and 20%
parsley unless I tell you different while you're up here."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Smoothies – for you,
like I said, have eggs and milk and honey only."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Once in a while, maybe the
fruit, but I wouldn't, because it'll make you irritable and emotional, and all
wound up...try to stay away from it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Be balanced.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And that can be blended together?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yup.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you can put as much fat in as you like, as you can digest."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","With your
liver problem, you don't wanna overburden it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because of that problem, it's
going to be harder for you to get through, than most people."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's not gonna be
like your brother, like that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yours is gonna be slower because there's some
severe damage there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And there's lots of scar tissue everywhere.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But you can
still recover."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, what was that I was going to finish talking about?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Regenerative...moldy meats...

Oh, moldy meats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Moldy foods in general - molds are there to break down the
substances that are clogged in your system, but there's no way to remove them
and dissolve them and eliminate them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You eat cooked foods, you destroy the
natural enzymes, everything in them, the bacteria, they're destroyed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Over.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Finit.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Nothing.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So when that food dries out in your system, that substance dries
out in your system, there's no way to dissolve it and remove it, except with
solvents."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","To get molds and bacterias in your body, if you will mold foods that
you ate a lot of cooked, you can eliminate them from your body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","To help get rid
of AGEs, I used to take wheat berries, rye berries, rice berries, I was a big
rice crispies, captain crunch, all those things, I was a heavy cereal eater."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So
I was full of those AGEs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I took those same grains and would germinate them
and then let them rot."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Black and white molds.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And then I would eat them.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","To help
get rid of mine quicker."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do you still recommend that?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Absolutely.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Should we do the same thing with potatoes too?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yup, you can do it with potatoes too."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Just remember, you don't want to have a
lot of it, because there are 2 things that happen with that: sometimes a black
mold will form, which is ergot."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And you can get high, because it's LSD."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And it
can be a nice high, but it doesn't really ground you into reality."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I haven't
experienced anybody that's had hallucinations from it, except when it was
pulling out, somebody who had intense LSD."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","People who had a lot of LSD, yes, it
would bring it out, and they would have reoccurences of hallucinations."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So
grains is something you probably want to take with...less often than you would
meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Meat is something you can do every week, rotten meat, fine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The grains, I
would do no more than one cycle of them about every 16-18 months."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And no more
than probably 2oz."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","2oz after it's...if you took 1oz of berries, and they swell
up, double the size, and then they mold and shrink a little bit, that's about
right."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","How long, the 2oz?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well you want to start taking it, you'll take about maybe 4-5 berries that have
molded every week, and you start at the 3rd week, and you go until you finish
them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",All molds have 17 stages that they go through.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And you want to eat them at
all those different stages."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You know the molding raspberries, they were staying red for the longest time,
there's hardly any mold on them and it's been...

You didn't let them mold outside the refrigerator first?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When you're molding berries, you wash them first, you let them get wet, you can
let them swell and get soggy, then you leave them out and they'll mold, the mold
will grow quickly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Once the mold starts growing, then put them in a jar and put
it in the refrigerator."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And in the book I talked about having a lot at one time,
and some people would go into chronic fatigue that could last anywhere from 30
days or a few weeks up to a year."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Another way to do it - again like the grain
berries you can use the raspberries and the other berries in the same way."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You
mold about a pint of them, you only take 3 berries a week."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And very rarely does
anyone go into a fatigue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And it'll only last for a few days.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Again that's to
destroy the mutant antibodies created either by antibiotics or vaccines that
feed on the proteins in your blood."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The somatids that make up the proteins.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So
you look like you have a lot of protein in your blood, but they're hollow, like
an empty egg."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I ate a lot of soy.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Can you do that with soy?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You ate a lot of soy?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's a difficult one.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because the soybean is poisonous
raw."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's a very difficult one.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Could you mold soy sprouts?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yes you could, that'd probably be your better way, but just remember that I
would do that very very lightly and only once in a while, and no more than
probably 5 grains, maybe 1 of them a week, and that's it, because...does
everybody know the soy ploy?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Soy is one of the most poisonous foods there is.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But it's high in protein, easy
to grow, and great marketing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Even vegetarian animals, herbivores, cannot eat
soy without getting sick."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They cannot feed it to animals in any large quantity,
an herbivore will not eat it in any quantity, even a goat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because there are

www.pricepottenger.com, and put in soy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Soy ploy.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And you'll come up with Dr.
Enig and Sally Fallon's research on it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What about the Japanese?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The Japanese only ate it in soy sauce.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",They never ate tofu.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That was an
industrialized thing that the japanese came up with later on, when soy started
becoming a marketable substance."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What about miso?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Miso is again almost all salt and soy.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But the fermentation, isn't that good for enzymes?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If it were raw fermentation, but they don't ferment any of that raw, and then
the salt counteracts some of the fermentation, yes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So, if you're going to make
a rotten food, make it raw."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If it's soy or grains, you need to germinate it or
it's not gonna do you any good."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And you need to germinate the grains until they
mold in the germination process."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Keep them wet.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Not completely covered, but keep
them wet so you see this white mold start growing and then when the blacks and
the other molds start growing, you know there are different stages."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And eat them
at all those different stages."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yes?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I came back from France, they say to mold the cheese, is that a good idea?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's a very good idea.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Cause we've all eaten lots of cooked cheese in our

life, that American stuff, Velveeta, how much Velveeta I ate, no wonder I was
so

sick."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That stuff was awful.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What about cheez whiz?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's plastic.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Who said that?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Phil, of course."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Cheez-whiz.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I also found that if you put it in a dark place, it seems to...the mold is
faster."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Right.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you leave it out at room temperature...if you'll take it out of its
package and then let air in...plastic bag, like a ziplock bag with air in it, it
will mold very quickly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",All different kinds of molds.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That may be a difficult
one, so only a little bit, cause I've seen people get fatigue, so eat only a
little bit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Maybe a little, let's say molds on the outside first, then work its
way in over the month inside, so when it gets on the outside, if you want it to
go blue, to blue cheese, you need to let it sit a longer time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If it's just the
white mold, that'll happen within a few days."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Shave some of that off.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But I
wouldn't have any more than a thin shaving like this, about as wide as the brick
is, and no more than 1"" long, per week."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Why would one...

And remember, don't mix these molds."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Don't go having...let's say I have my
moldy berries this week, and I have my rotten fish this week, and I have my
moldy grains this week."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No no, one mold a week, that's it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Or else you'll find
yourself fatigued."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",This is a 40-year process.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do it intelligently.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So why would one be tired from this?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",From the molds.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The molds are there to decompose substances, that's what molds
do."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you start molding, you got a lot of molds in your body, breaking down
toxicity in your system, all of your energy and nutrients are going to handle
that, and you're not going to have any energy to do things."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What's your name again?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Richard.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",There we go.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, the left teste is pretty normal, adrenal glands have been
off and on overactive, the right teste is very overactive, right adrenal gland
was pretty overactive."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The adrenals right now are inflamed.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The pancreas is
inflamed and edemic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Pancreas is probably working only about 20-25%.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","One fruit
with high carbohydrate in it, maybe only once every 2 days, always eat high fat
with it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","RBC count is very good, however, the oxygen is not being transported
very well with the RBCs, so the RBCs aren't very strong."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'm going to suggest
that you have 25% parsley and 10% zucchini or summer squash, you know the
yellow, and 55% celery."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",For about 6 weeks.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And then go to 15-20% parsley, 60-70%
celery, and then zucchini or cucumber for the remainder."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You have fat cells
clumping like leukosis in your glands, thyroid, parathyroid, in the throat area."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You had a tonsillectomy.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Lots of scar tissue there from it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And the lymph glands
and the thyroid aren't so good."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You need lots of moldy meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Or high meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Bacteria meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",About 70% of your meat should be red meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","10% seafood and 20%
fowl."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I would suggest that you do some walking.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Maybe even do some push-ups.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because you have that congestion in your glands, it'll get that all moving if
you do that kind of movement, or chin-ups, something that'll get that going a
little bit better."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The reason I said zucchini is because you have a lot of lead
and toxic minerals stored in your limb and your brain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","A little bit in your
spinal cord, mid-back."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When you do have fruit, I suggest you have pineapple."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But
not very much."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You seem to have a hiatal hernia.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Which is the membrane between
the stomach and the lungs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's almost all scar tissue and lots of congestion in
there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Sometimes that creates a very acid condition in here, soreness, burning."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Eating whole coconut can relieve that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's about the only thing I've seen
relieve it, when it's this pronounced."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When I've seen it this pronounced,
usually it takes 10-20 years to completely get rid of it, but it can be gotten
rid of."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Most people live with that all their life and it gets worse and worse
and worse until they have to have almost everything removed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But you can reverse
yours, just have to be patient."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Have you ever had a hernia?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not to my knowledge.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I have had pain in those areas, but I never consulted any
medical people."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Well you've got some ulcerations down there.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And that's going to form into scar
tissue like the hiatal is."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I suggest that 3 ½ cups be that other juice, and
then ½ cup the white cabbage, about ½ cup a day which is 4 oz, every 3 days,
for about 8 weeks."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And that should resolve the hemorrhaging.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's not gonna
resolve the pain for a long long time, all of it, but it'll get rid of most of
it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",80%.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So it won't even be that noticeable.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But you still may have a sharp
pain every once in a while."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Did you work around heavy metals like lead?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Where did you grow up?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",New York.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, you must have been allergic to all those heavy metals in the air."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because
they're all throughout your lungs and chest cavity."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The bronchials, everywhere."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And it's just sitting in there.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Tomatoes, eat tomatoes with cheese, maybe 3 days
a week."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I recommend that you have about 8-10 eggs a day, right around 8."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Are
you living where you can get milk?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not really.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Or no.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'll have to order it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Go get it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The Clareville milk, it's a great milk."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I recommend that you have a
quart a day of milk."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What about headaches?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, if you let it sit and clabber like I do, let it sit out for 3 days at
room temperature, and don't leave it in those bottles, you saw the quart jars
with the wide mouth that Jill has, put it in that, and don't fill it all the
way, put a lid on it, so some air will get in there, and it'll clabber quicker."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You should use a natural clabber though.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I would rather that the milk digest
itself rather than adding rennet, because the rennet for you won't work."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I need
the milk to break down properly on its own, for your system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And the headaches
you're going to have because you have the heavy lead and mineral toxicity, it's
all in here, and when that dumps into the blood, you get high blood pressure."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Go
for the pain formula that I gave."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That'll help counteract that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So two your eggs
in that, some of the cream, the bee pollen, everything, that'll take care of
most your headache."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you can still function, at least."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But you can't go
without that side effect."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You need to eliminate it. (
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Long pause)

Boysenberries and blackberries will help you also get rid of those metals
faster."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And if you're gonna mold some, mold those particular berries."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Do you
have any questions?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I think that'll do.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Thank you.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Could you put it on pause for a minute?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",All right.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What is your name?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Andrew.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay Andrew.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",This guy should be an athlete.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Or a prostitute.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Very very
overactive sex glands and adrenals."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I hope you have a very active partner.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If
not, you need to take care of yourself."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because that many hormones building up
can make you a very irritable man."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Or distract you entirely.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The pancreas is
about 60% functional, but not very healthy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you can handle 1 piece of fruit a
day, as long as you eat it with something."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you eat fruit without fat, it's
likely to increase your sexuality, and make you more uncomfortable."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Restless?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Very.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Not necessarily more emotional, that will, it'll work up to that
eventually."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But you, will make more restless and irritable."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Circulation's good
in the spine and the limbs, lots of bile collecting everywhere."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Your liver's not
in good shape."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The lymph glands around the liver are very congested.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The liver's done as much
as it can do until its whole environment changes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","(Pause)

There's a lot of metal toxicity in your right teste."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What that is going to do,
eventually, when that starts coming out, that whole area, between your rectum
and your scrotum is going to inflame, and could last for couple of years, and
itch at times, who knows when that's going to happen in the next 40 years, but
it will happen probably several times."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Metals?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Mm-hm.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Why they've stored mainly in the right teste, I don't know."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Also in the
sinuses on the right side, all up in here."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do you work with welding?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I've previously done a lot of welding.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Also a lot of solvents.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Metal work.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Metal shavings, dust."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, it's really lodged, and it's basically poisoned your liver."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you need
lots and lots of eggs, up to 28 a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That'll break my previous record.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And your record so far has been?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I could eat easily 8-10, without...

Nothing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","For you, that's nothing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You need a lot.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Tip of the iceberg...

Are you working out, do you exercise?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I have physical work, I don't exercise purposefully, outside of...

What do you do?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Landscaping.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh, that's very active."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, then you can definitely eat 20-28 eggs a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's the only way I see you're going to get rid of that bile.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You don't have
to do it every day, all the time, but you need to just load your body up with
it, you need to get fat around here, and then take it off, and get fat around
there, because if this bile with that kind of metal toxicity and solvents gets
to your intestines without enough fat around here, it's going to put holes in
your intestines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And then you'll find yourself not able to function.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So, you
want to make sure you can build that up."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Cheese is going to be very helpful too,
because when your body takes some of that, it's going to dump it right into the
stomach, and the cheese will help absorb it, so you won't have so much nausea."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",There'll be times when you probably will have to vomit it up.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How about mineral deficiency?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, definitely creates a mineral deficiency, but the cheese will help correct
that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And the milk.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And I recommend 1-2 quarts a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Lots of milk and lots of
eggs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I would say concentrate on those for about 6 weeks, 6 days a week, and
maybe ½ lb of meat every day, of various types of meats, I'll get into what
percentage in a minute, and then after about 6 weeks, increase it up to about 1
lb of meat a day, and cut the eggs down to about 12-20 a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But for 6 weeks,
go 20-28 a day, ½ lb meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And keep up your juice, vegetable juice."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Maybe you
can let it go one day, 2 days a week, but never 2 days in a row."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Berries I would
wait until maybe August before you start eating berries."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because that's going to
pull them out even quicker."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I would just like to make sure that your body is
stabilized everywhere, so when that solvent and those metals come out into your
system, that your system will be protected."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So the chance of damage will be
minimized."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's an older exposure.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's not a day-to-day thing currently.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","This is...

But it's in glands."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's very fluid.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Luckily I'm not taking it in currently.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, it would look differently if you were taking it in now."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","This is
old and deep."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's all in your bones, in your arms, in your ribs, especially in
the right teste, and in your brain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Sinuses.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The thyroid looks okay, it's got
some metal toxicity."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Parathyroids are underactive.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Tonsils and adenoids, looks
like scar there, so they look like they've been removed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, I have them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You have them?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Where's my flashlight?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Got a little one?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",All right.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Say 'ah'.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Way down.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Put your tongue out and down.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Now say ah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Quite a bit deteriorated.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I
want to get mine, mine's a little bit brighter."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because I need to see them
again."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do you have a...?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That'll work.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Did I swallow my tonsils somewhere along the way?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, sometimes solvents will actually cause them to just deteriorate,
disintegrate."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Say ah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yup, that one's almost completely gone, and it's
very dark."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And so is this one.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I can see that this one, the left one, is a
little bit better, though."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But there's no, you can't even see a gland."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There's
no scar tissue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It looks like the gland is just eaten away.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What do the tonsils do, what's important about them?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Well they break down certain toxicity and protect the brain.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","How can people protect themselves from solvents and chemicals and things like
that?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Wearing masks.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And putting oil, like olive oil, peanut oil, on the hands."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I was a heavy equipment mechanic for years.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I've had enough, there's so many
chemicals in used motor oil."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Fuels, solvents, and lubricants, and it goes right
into your cuticles, right into your nails, it soaks in."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And that was a daily
thing for me for years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And breathing it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And you breathe it all.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So there's no food that you can take to protect you?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, well, you can eat lots of fats, which will help, like milk and cream and
stuff like that, to buffer it, and then coating your arms, where you're touching
it, and wearing gloves."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's about all you can do.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But you can't really
prevent it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Also you need to stay away from using any kind of oils other than a
natural oil."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Fragrant oils, any of them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Aromatics.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Aromatics, any of them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Are solvents again for you.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If someone could create...

Something like citrus maybe?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Well you could use those.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Rind, and just squeeze it on you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, they're all heat-processed, even Young's which are distilled at 257 deg,
he says in his book nature does it at 62-72 deg."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not 257 deg.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So his oils are
better than those that are done at 357 and higher."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But still, his are done at
257 deg."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's too high.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Turns it into plastic.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And it has a very toxic
vaporous reaction."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So if you want real oils that will be fragrant for you, eat
the flower petals."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Early in the morning, before oils vaporize."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That means any kind of soap with any essential oil is inadvisable?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Right.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I don't use soaps at all.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What do you use?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I blend 1 egg, 3oz vegetable juice, 2 oz milk, and 1 tbsp honey."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I use that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I
put it on my hair when it's dry."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I didn't do that today because I didn't have
access."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I just put straight milk on my hair today.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do you wash your hands after using facilities?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yea.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I recommend that you do not wash your hands after facilities.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I
recommended that you touch yourself with that E Coli and Salmonella and
everything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Some of my cancer clients, believe it or not, and this is going to
get out, because this is the first time I'm saying it publicly, I have them take
rotten meat after they've gone to the bathroom before they wiped themselves, to
take their finger over their rectum, and to rub it on the meat and let it rot."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That way they'll ensure the high E Coli and the high veritoxins produced by it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And like I said, the university of toronto has shrunk entire brain tumours along
with the vessels going to it in a matter of 7-15 days with one injection of
veritoxin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What about all those babies that died and mothers that died while giving birth
before doctors figured out to wash their hands, that whole...?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Everybody likes to theorize what was responsible.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","A lot of women were not able
to get access to meats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So they were low on protein?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Very low on protein, and mainly lived on carbohydrates."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And they were very
thin, and had very low fat levels."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So both they and the babies would die under
high strain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","A lot of women died that way just from being thin, from weather
temperature changes, because it was not easy to build fires."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Stoves were
expensive, even potbelly stoves."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So there weren't a lot of homes that had them.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Women were considered healthy if they were fat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You couldn't get a wealthy man
to marry a skinny woman 100 years ago."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He would reject her in a flash because
the odds of her dying in either heat prostration or hypothermia were about 90%."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You see it in the art too.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Oh absolutely.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now that we have heaters and we have all this convenience,
skinny people don't die so easily."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And a lot of them would die in
childbirth because you need a lot of fats to have a good birthing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yes Jon?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","How about washing your hands after using facilities, what about in public
restrooms?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I don't touch anything there, I just touch myself."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They have all these
electronic ones now, but I'll hit with my elbow or something like that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But I
don't worry about germs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I want them.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's not that I'm worried about germs, there's a lot of great germs in
restrooms."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Like at airports, and they come from all over the world."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You know I don't mind as long as they're organic germs.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What bothers me is
man-made germs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Like the war department's AIDS virus and stuff like that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",They're not as easy to handle.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How would we protect against that?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","We've got these phenomena – chemtrails
flying everywhere, one wonders what kind of fungus or bacteria is coming down,
that are man-made, and war germs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, I did about 5 months research on the chemtrails."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And basically they're
trying to handle the ozone layer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's what I've heard.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",They're trying to deflect global warming.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And what they're doing is they're
spraying an aluminum compound, which is a neurotoxin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And it destroys natural
bacteria that's in the atmosphere, that's suspended in clouds."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You have lots of
bacteria, you have protozoa, you have what they call sea monkeys."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",They live in water droplets.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They live in water droplets, exactly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And when you release that aluminum
compound, it kills them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Then more bacteria feeds on all these other animal type
compounds."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So that's why they're finding so many different levels and kinds of
bacteria in it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's because these aluminum compounds are destroying, poisoning
the atmosphere, just like it poisons a human body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because we've been getting dosage after, oh gosh, months and months, almost
every day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What do you do to protect yourself?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not easy.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The only way you can protect yourself against neurotoxins is by
drinking cream, milk, milk and cream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And eggs.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But milk and cream are your best
bet for that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But you need to get in touch with your congresspeople and say
“hey, poisoning me is not the way to handle the atmosphere toxins, you need to
cut out fossil fuel.”"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Period.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's the only resolution.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'm just wondering what she was talking about, she knew that it was happening
here...

Oh, I've been photographing it, going to the supervisors about it, doctors, …

What, is it in the air?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh yea,...

Well it's the airplanes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You see the airplanes making these white streaks and
they don't go away, they don't evaporate, and they stay as clouds."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I didn't know what that was.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yea, that's trying to deflect the sun rays back out of the atmosphere."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because of global warming?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Amazing...Amazing...

And it only works about 1-2%."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And then the pollution is greater than 1-2%, so
it's really stupid."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Really stupid.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I've been trying to get that word out,...so that people know about it...

Oh, it's stupid."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's asinine.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",One billion dollars a year.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Hughes aircraft has
the contract."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And they're using the military planes to do it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There's a high level of cancer in this area, I mean extraordinary."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'm
wondering if that's connected with that."

really."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, it's low bacterias, high everything, it's happening everywhere."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Cancer is
everywhere."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Is there a specific meat I should be thinking of to clear some of those toxic
metals and solvents and whatnot?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, the things that are going to get rid of that, is lots of eggs, and zucchini
along the line."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And even eating some late at night.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The last thing you have with
your vegetable juice is a little zucchini, that'll help pull it out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But you
really need to stabilize before you do it because your liver isn't real active,
and you've got a lot of bile."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Throughout your entire system, like his sister."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Where'd she go?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","She...

Oh."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Kathleen...

No meat in particular, not fish, or more red meat, or just...

Well, you need to just, like I say, didn't I tell you what proportion?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No I
didn't?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","About 65% red meat, about 25% fowl, and 10-15% fish."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","For about 1.5 years, 18 months."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Then you'll probably change at that time.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Are these percentages by weight?Volume?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Volume.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Or weight, it's about the same."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Juice, it's fluid volume?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And when you say those percentages, you mean every day, or over a week?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You can work it out to a week's period.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you can eat beef one day and...

Yeah, you can eat all beef one day, unless you're very delicate."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And he's not
delicate."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Kathleen's delicate.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So I would ask her to do it on a daily basis.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","To
do those percentages on a daily basis, to have all of them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But other people who
aren't fragile like that, they can mix it over a week and make it work out to
those percentages."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, next."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You still have all that bile.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Your skin's looking so much better though.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You
notice it too?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, you did get a lot of the bile out because now I can see why
you are having so much fatigue and so many problems."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You also have metals stored
all up in your sinuses and in your brain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Ah, that's why I have a constant open sore in my nose."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So what metals, poisonings were you around?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Mainly on the left side.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do you have metal fillings?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not any more.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Usually metal fillings won't create that abundance of it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'll find it just
lodged a little bit, but this is tremendous."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How about lead from water pipes?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They soldered with lead, or they used to."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I've never seen it from that, this is usually some kind of exposure to
some art medium, whether it's stain glass, or working with solvents, or being
raised in a city where there's lots of heavy combustion pollution."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, I hate cities."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The left side of your small intestines are very very congested still.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh, this
is Pascal."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I don't know if I've been saying the names each time.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'd like you to
have 5-10% of your juice now as dandelion."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What is that?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Dandelion greens.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Should help those intestines that are just...lots of scar
tissue there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Those AGEs.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Dandelion greens, because of the high vitamin C in it,
will help go in there and dissolve it a little bit better."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I've been constipated most of my life, does that mean I will be constipated a
lot again?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, you just have so much scar tissue there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There's low intestinal bacteria
because of that, low intestinal flora, low digestive enzyme reaction."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So in
order to really get that moving properly we need to get rid of the scar tissue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","As I told you before though, if you use the suppository of the...anybody who has
constipation, they really want to help remove it permanently rather than the
quick fix that I gave which was vegetable juice, the eggs, and the milk, and the
vinegar, and the honey – all those things are indigestible together, so it'll
just wash things through, loosen you quickly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you want to heal that, you've
got to increase the bacteria level in your colon."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Fecal matter is normally
60-80% bacteria."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","E Coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The fecal matter, if we
didn't have those bacteria, would be about the size of marbles, and it'd be the
texture of granite, and they'd go through and just rip you apart every time you
had a movement."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Bacteria feeds on it, sponges it out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","All its byproducts are the
B-vitamins, the amino acids that they manufacture, the veritoxins that prevent
tumor growth and storage of dead cells."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It helps all of that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So all of that's
good."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",There are even people who eat fecal matter.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",To re-utilize their proteins.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Animals do that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Does anybody know who Dr. Edward Howell is?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He was the man who discovered
enzymes and did the research on enzymes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",He fed rats cooked diets and raw diets.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The ones who ate cooked diets, all got diseases of man, the ones who ate raw,
didn't get any diseases."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Curious thing was, with all that disease, usually you
would expect the lifespan to be shortened."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But the lifespan was equal for the
ones who ate cooked and the ones who ate raw."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But one thing in his notes that he
didn't become conscious of until after he's looking at the information, was that
the rats who were eating cooked food ate all of their feces."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The ones who ate
raw food did not eat their feces."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So the next test, he took the rats and put
them on a screen, so they could not eat their feces, they'd fall through."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They
lived only 2 years instead of 3 years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So there's lots of animals that will eat
their fecal matter when they need the bacteria to flush back into their system,
or they're not finished digesting what they ate, to recycle it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There's nothing left, if we're down to that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But they use it as a remedy in some countries.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And urine too.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So when somebody says “eat shit”, you go “thank you.”"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",“Thank you!”
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Exactly.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh please, you're causing me to blush."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I suggest you
eat from 35-40% fish, for about 3.5 weeks."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That'll help get some of that metal
toxicity out of there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And along with that, the dandelion greens will probably
get your intestines working a little bit better."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What I was going to say, is if
you want to get the bacteria in your intestines going, in your bowels, take
clabbered milk that you've clabbered for about 4 days into solid-like yogurt."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Take an enema bulb syringe, put about 3-4oz in there, get on all fours, bark,
and then insert it in your rectum."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Then get down on your shoulders on your
knees, and your butt still up in the air, and roll you stomach like a belly
dancer to get it down, moving into the transverse colon, then roll on your right
side, belly dance again, roll your stomach, and get it to go down into the
ascending colon, so that the E Coli, the Salmonella, the Campylobacter will have
something that's non-toxic to feed on."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because since you're so toxic, you're
gonna be putting out toxins in your fecal matter, that the bacteria sometimes
will not work on."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Especially with heavy metals in their system.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So the bacteria
doesn't touch it, or it actually will destroy the colonies of bacteria, it will
poison them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And the only way that you can re-introduce that and keep them fed
is maybe once a week doing this clabbered milk suppository."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Is it the whey part, or the solid part, or both?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, when you've got it at a clabbered stage, there's no separation."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because mine always separates.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's because you've taken it too far.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Before that, yes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And that'll help grow
that bacteria so you'll move better."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But until you get rid of that scar tissue,
you're going to have to do that on a weekly basis."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I really like the fish, the tuna, and a friend of mine told me that in Hawaii,
it has so much mercury in it, that it's really toxic to the liver, so I've
stopped, and I was gonna ask you about that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you cook fish, it causes the mercury to be a free radical."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When you do
not eat it cooked, it will not be absorbed as a toxin in your body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The mercury
in swordfish is a very healthy mercury, and helps that creature be very buoyant."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It can dive and jump very high.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Without that mercury it wouldn't be as buoyant.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It wouldn't move as fast.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's non-toxic until you cook it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And then you've made
it a free radical."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And it is a poison.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So as long as it's not fed high levels of
toxic mercury to the point where the fish itself has tumors and is diseased,
it's not going to be a problem for you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because my tests showed that if you eat
the animal raw, the toxicity passes out with the fat chelated with it, without
any digestion."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Without any breakdown of that fat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Or that chelative compound.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So
you eat that tuna."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Enjoy it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Your glands are in great shape now.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Everything's working well.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Your liver and
your kidneys are not."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And your intestines.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Everything is working better.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What about the pancreas?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Pancreas is a little bit better.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It hasn't regenerated, but that that you have
is now at least working."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So, your pancreas is probably working about 30%."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And
it's working very well for that 30%."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So still no more than a piece of fruit a
day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And, it doesn't have to be that often."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You do not really need fruit.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Some
people do, but mainly, most people do not need fruit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Some people that have a
lot of fat congestion, I do recommend having pineapple."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And that's when I've
said that to the individual."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You said to me if I have fruit, that's the one I should have."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Well also the pineapple can help break down scar tissue.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But I would suggest
that you start eating high meat in the next few months."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But it looks a lot
better."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Your red blood cell count is still low.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What do I need for that?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Red meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's what I've been craving most.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you don't need a lot of
chicken right now, you need mainly red meat and fish."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","…

Yes it will now."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I hear that the fish have a lot of toxic metals and chemicals in them and that
they're not good to eat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I just addressed that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The ocean is only 2% polluted.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The earth is 36%
polluted."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So are you safer by eating land food, or ocean food?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And the
freshwater pollution is like 48-50%."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I don't eat any freshwater fish.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But what about animal fat?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Animal fat's wonderful.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Doesn't it have high pollution?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well I will not eat fat from animals who've been fed hormones and antibiotics
and vaccines, stuff like that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But what about toxic metals, doesn't that store in the fat?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yes, but as long as you don't cook them, they won't be released in your system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",They'll pass through.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So the fat is not connected to the toxins?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yes, they chelate with the toxins, but in my lab tests, it showed that the body
could identify that when it wasn't cooked."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It did not break that fat down, just
passed it through with the toxins."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And the rest inside is broken down?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The animal already dealt with toxicity and encapsulated it, so it could deal
with it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Correct.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And then when your body takes it in, as long as you don't cook it, it
can identify that, and there's a symbiotic process, passes it through."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What about the idea that the big fish eat the little fish, the concentrations
of toxic materials are larger in bigger animals?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Well if they're feeding on land creatures that will definitely be a response.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But if you've gone around polluted areas, most of those fish won't touch those
little fish that are so polluted and full of tumors."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",They won't eat them.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You'll
see them floating around dead."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And no fish is eating them.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Aajonus, I have a theoretically simple question, and that is to do with water."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Drinking water.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","We have a spring here in … called … and I had it lab tested
and they said that it was 50-100 vegetal coliforms per the little thing I
brought in."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Would that be good water to drink, or what water would you suggest
drinking?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No water.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No water?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Really?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'm very hard against water.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Water is nothing other than minerals without any
nutrients."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And what do minerals do?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Minerals attract nutrients.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They pull them
out of your blood, pull them into your intestines, and what are you doing?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Washing nutrients out of the body.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And they dry the system out.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I suggest a
quart of juice a day, at least a quart of milk a day, and that usually handles
it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Now some people do need a little water.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So if you're craving water, then
drink a little bit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I maybe have during the winter in this time, 3oz of water a
week."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And that's it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But I may go through 2 quarts of milk a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Plus my juice.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","...glasses of water a day...urine...

Well, before I was on a diet like this, I was drinking 2 gallons of water a
day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And by drinking 2 quarts of milk and 1 quart of vegetable juice, it more
than satisfies me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And I'm not over the toilet every hour.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Does that in any way mirror what animals do in the wild, how much water do they
consume relative to their...?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It depends upon the animal, if you're a camel, you can take up to 25 gallons at
a time and not drink for six weeks."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But other animals drink very little water.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Depends on how hot it is.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Probably birds drink more water than any other creature.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",They also consume grains.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Dry grains all the time.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yes, so much."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You notice that when they feed on
insects, they don't drink much water."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But when it's season for seeds, they will
drink more water."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Your name again?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ursula.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ursula.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay Ursula, you have very very little protein in your system,
everything is debilitated."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Your glands, there's no rounding, everything is
sunken."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I only see hands like this on people who've eaten mainly grains in their
life, or were vegetarians for a very very long time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",25 years.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You still maintain a pretty good RBC count, and that's because your system is
basically over-acidic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Very overactive adrenal glands.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Overactive?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You used to have overactive adrenal glands.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I can see that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Your ovaries at one
time had been very overactive."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Now everything's underactive.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The only thing that
looks like it's still overactive is your right parathyroids."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Do you have your
tonsils?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'll use this end.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Say ah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Put your tongue out.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Say ah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Definitely scar tissue.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Must be lymph glands that are very overactive around in your neck.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Do you have
swollen glands there?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Thyroids basically are not very active.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Parathyroids
are trying to do the work."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You need lots of chicken, lots of beef, a little
fish."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The fish you need...whenever you eat beef you need to eat a little bit,
let's say for 5-6 bites of red meat you need one bite of fish, to help
re-balance you, because you're over-acidic, and you're not gonna have a taste
for it, and you won't digest very well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because you're low in all kinds of
digestive bacterias, it'll be easier for you to eat, if you eat, it's very
restrictive, but more mono-meals, like meat with maybe a little sauce, like a
salsa sauce, so it's not confusing your digestion too much."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's a problem
with vegetarians that I've seen over the years, they lose so many digestive
enzymes and so many digestive abilities that they have to reduce everything to
mono-meals."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And you're definitely in that category.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I would say, if you're
going to have, a smoothie, have 2 or 3 eggs with only maybe 2-3oz of cream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I can't digest the eggs very well.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The raw eggs, I've been trying to do that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Clabbered milk.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Just clabbered milk and eggs?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I tried ½ or 1/3 of a banana just for flavor, but I've also done it
without that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And I still had trouble with it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Well I don't want you to have the milk.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I want you to just have the cream.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","2oz
of cream with 3 eggs and some honey."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now sometimes you have a reaction with the
honey with that mixture."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Usually it doesn't happen because the 2oz of raw cream
prevents that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And you can utilize the honey.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Can you have problems with the honey?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well you're having it with enough fat, so there's enough fats in the egg, and
all of that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Coconut cream?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, coconut cream is fine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I prefer cow's cream for your system.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But coconut
cream is better than nothing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Better than no rich fat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because your body has so
many AGEs in it, you have yeasts growing in everything, even in your bones."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You're going to have a reaction when it comes out your skin.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So what I suggest
that you do, is...and this is a great moisturizer for everybody who would like
to help their skin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And when toxins pass through the skin.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Take 3.5oz of cream.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Juice ginger to get 1tbsp.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So it's 1tbsp to 3.5oz of raw cream.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Blend that for
about 10sec, and put it on your skin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you have good thick cream, then it'll
whip into a whipped cream, and it's just like putting a cosmetic cream on."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's
very nice."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If it isn't a thick cream, then it will not whip and it's still good,
it just doesn't go as far."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I would put that on your skin, so that when you
have that, when your body's...the honey does not create a candida, an
environment for candida, honey helps detoxify the yeasts that are candida."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Get
rid of them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So as they pass through, you have the itchy and the flaky and the
dryness resulting from it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So if you have enough fats with it, like you have
that many eggs, 3 eggs with 2oz of cream, and you're just having a little honey,
when it comes out, it's not going to drive you crazy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I would suggest that
when raw butter if available, you eat a stick a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You just need everything
lubricated and stabilized."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And then eat lots of chicken, when it comes to that,
lots of chicken, and beef."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And just a little bit of fish, just to keep you
alkalinized."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I doubt that I would even...if I were you, I would suggest that
you...even with chicken have a little piece of fish with it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Just to make sure
you don't get too acid."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You also have lots of metal toxicity in your sinuses and
throat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Nasal bones.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Bronchials.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I recommend that your juice be 70% celery,
20% parsley, and 10% zucchini or yellow squash."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","...the timespan that I've given you, whether it was 6 weeks, to 18 months, you
can add about 10% carrot juice in it to help get rid of the bile."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But make sure
that you stabilize as long as I suggest before you do that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And you have lots of
bile everywhere too."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I suggest you stabilize before you start removing that
bile."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So by stabilizing I eat just what you recommend?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yup.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And like I say, when the butter comes out, and cream comes out, I would
consume a lot of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And I would gain a lot of weight.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And then take it off, and
gain a lot, and take it off."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The reason I'm saying this is because I've seen
situations like yours go into lupus."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And lupus is so difficult.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You can't lift
anything, you can't touch anything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I had arthritis...

Well it's one more stage toward that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When that starts happening, between,..in
the connective tissues."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Swelling, everything's so sensitive, you can't pick up
anything, you can't touch things, you can't do your clothes easily, at advanced
stages of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",At some point you're going to need lots of bacteria.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","From
meats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I don't suggest you use grain bacteria, molds, or berry molds, for a very
very long time, maybe 3-4 years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Just meat bacteria.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",For a while.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you do do
those, it could throw you into lupus."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So I don't suggest that you do those.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I
recommend that you do 10-12 eggs a day, when you can utilize them properly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So
you work up to that, when you can do it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Even if it takes 1.5 years.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Do you like
red bell peppers?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You can have that, make kind of a sauce with cheese, cream, you may have a lot
of trouble with milk at first."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not clabbered milk.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And you're able to handle the clabbered milk?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yes, surprisingly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But not with the egg?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, it's not the milk, it's the egg that's...

Yea, but it's the combination."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's why I want you to have the cream with the
egg."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You could blend egg, red bell pepper, and a little cheese to make a sauce
for your meats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","How about feta, raw goat feta, is that good, or is that too salty?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's too salty.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Salt for you is absolute poison.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And when you can get honey in
the comb, eat the wax, except for the sheet in between."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Scrape the wax off and
eat it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because the wax will help stabilize and protect your kidneys.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Kidneys
are very exposed, very vulnerable."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Let me see your eyes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Pineapple is likely to
make you very irritable, even if you have a little bit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I would say that if
you go into a store that may have a few pieces of pineapple out, you just buy a
couple of pieces."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Like 2 pieces only.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Little squares or wedges of them.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And
maybe twice a week, have that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But no more than that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And always eat it with an
egg, and some cheese, even if you've just downed the egg rocky style, and then
eat the cheese and the pineapple together."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do you have any questions?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'm overwhelmed by all of this...

I'm sure."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The fragility?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's because you have no fats in your system.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No protection, and you have all
those sugars."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",AGEs stored everywhere.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Even though I don't eat sugar?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Carbohydrates.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Not much...

Grains, breads, all that for over the years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Then it's from the past, because...

Definitely."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And you're just so fat deficient, you have no protection anywhere."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And you have all these yeasts feeding on the AGEs.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And you're exposed to all
those acids, so they'll irritate your nervous system all the time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's why I
say, when you can get that cream and butter, just start drinking that stuff."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So the proteins...I have all these things in my mind that we've learned over
the years, that protein is hard on your kidneys, excessive...

It is when it's cooked."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Just remember that those things that damage the kidney
are the lipid peroxides and the heterocyclic amines, that irritate and damage
the kidneys."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Those are only formed from cooking.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not from raw.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Easiest way to
stabilize your kidneys is to eat meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Especially red meat and chicken.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","How are steamed vegetables like broccoli, zucchini, any of that stuff?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, because they create resins, that will block the system, that turn into
plastic basically."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's in the book, so if you get to that...

I read it, I just don't remember it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Thank you.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You're welcome.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'm going to have to get some more milk.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh no, I've got some
here."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Never mind.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I drank that hours ago.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh, that's it, okay."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I look for some
more juice, but that's all gone."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, who's next?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I guess I'll go.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Can we have a fight here?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'd like to see some action.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Turn around this way.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Lance.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay Lance, your testes are very overactive."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you don't have a partner, enjoy
yourself."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because they will make you very anxious and unsettled.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There are
certain types of fat that you're not digesting properly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So it's causing an
inability to use minerals and proteins together."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So it's causing a buckling of
the tendons, tightening of them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Tightening of everything.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Coconut will be very
helpful to dissolve some of the hardened matter."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Coconut cream.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Whole coconut
too."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You have heavy metal toxicity in your shoulders, in your neck, in your
spine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Looks like a little bit in your pancreas.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Your left thyroid, looks like
it's very toxic, doesn't work very well, it looks stable, it looks like the
tissues are all there, it doesn't look debilitated, but it's not functioning."

it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Looks like the tonsils are gone, but the lymph glands are working very well
in the neck."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Did you have your tonsils removed?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's completely flat here.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",See this one looks like it's here.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Tonsil's here,
but over here it's not there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So it's probably deteriorated, and this one's
fine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I always like to check this one.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Wow.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yup.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The right one's amazing, the
left one is almost all deteriorated."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",75% deteriorated.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The other one's nice and
formed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Parathyroids on the right side very active, overactive, compensating for
the low activity of the right side of the thyroid."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I think you should make
coconut cream as a regular thing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Probably 12oz a week.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And you should have them
with your meats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So do more like...you'll be good in the Polynesians, the South
Pacific."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because they have coconut cream with almost all their meats.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But do not
have the lime juice with it, unless it's fish or chicken."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not with the red meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I suggest you have coconut cream, even if it's only 1tbsp, every time you eat
meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh, and everybody, try to work up to a minimum of 1lb of meat a day."

didn't tell people that."

people no."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'm going to suggest...I usually don't suggest it, but I'd like you
to eat one salad a week, and have it as the last meal in the day with some
vegetable juice, so that no other food comes in for 5-8 hours after you've eaten
it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Are you a teacher?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, I'm a sheet metal worker."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So that's why all that metal poisoning too.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You'd be a great teacher.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'm a shop...so I am teaching to a certain extent.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You have to go into teaching.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Very good at it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Enjoy it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Teach shop.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You need
to eat a lot of shellfish."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Probably the only way you're going to get that metal
toxicity out of your system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oysters, clams, urchin, scallops, and have it with
some kind of a tomato sauce with some tomato and lime juice and coconut cream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Sounds good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's not mine, that's a Polynesian recipe I got in Moorea...but it'd be very
good for what you need to remove, some of that toxicity."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I recommend that you
have about 1.5 quarts of milk a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Butter when it becomes available, about ¼
of a stick a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",1.5 quarts of milk?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And a quart of vegetable juice.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You could even have 5 cups a day,
sometimes, when it gets hotter."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Especially if you're in a metal shop.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's
really hot and steamy in there, you can go up to 6 cups if it gets...because you
need all those vitamins and minerals and enzymes that you can get."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I would
start taking some of the spectrum natural olive oil, and rub it into your hands
several times a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Before you put it on, take a clean towel, and wipe it off,
and then put it back on."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So you're not absorbing a lot of that here.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And of
course if you're shaving or grinding you need to wear a mask."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, I've been doing that these days."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Getting used to doing those precautions.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now that you're getting older, you know better."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The feedback's apparent now.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Just want to say this about your relationships – don't take your teaching
nature into relationships."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you're the martyr in the relationship, you're
never going to be happy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you have an affinity to try to fix your
relationships."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Fix the other person.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And then you'll always be the one thinking
that you're giving and not receiving."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But you set yourself up for that if you do
that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And that seems to be a pretty important thing to you.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Is how you
communicate in your relationships."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, it is important."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I would say, don't be the martyr, don't be the teacher."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Just be a sharer.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","'My experience is this, you have to do what's right for you.'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You'll be fine.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Cheese – something you should have, at least a brick a week."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If I start eating any cheese at all, I find myself binging on it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's a brick
at a time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But that's because you're going for the cheese like that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I was just gonna say,
if you grate some with your meat, then that'll be fine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's not
necessarily a bad thing, because you just need a lot in there to chelate with
the toxicity that dumps into the stomach."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But binging on it is probably not a
good balanced diet for you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No it's not.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So if you shave it off and have it with your food, you won't be able to eat
more meat by grating your cheese on it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But just let that be the condiment on
your food."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Entice you to eat more food, but not cheese."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It'll even taste better
that way."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Any more questions?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well I have this horrendous problem going on with, I guess it's Candida, and of
course going on with that is endless craving for fruit, which I keep
fluctuating, it's like I can get it reduced down to really small, and then
pretty soon it's like I'm consuming a lot again, and it's like I just seem not
to be able to get out of that cycle...

Well, it doesn't look like you have a real Candida problem."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It looks like you
have dryness everywhere."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I have a lot of gas, it's the problem, and then when there's a lot of gas,
there's a lot of pain, and...

So, get myself lubricated with the fats, is that...

That's the way you need to go about it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Eggs, and the cream, coconut cream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So what was it you said, how many ounces of cream a day?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",10 I think of coconut?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, 12 a week, minimum."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So you can divide that up.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's minimum.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Aajonus, any particular veggie juice combination for him?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",For him?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I thought I said, 70% celery, 20% parsley and 10% zucchini or yellow
squash."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Didn't I say that?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Maybe I didn't.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Question on the coconut cream – how do Polynesians make that?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, if it's the young coconut, they just scoop it out and then wring it
through a cloth."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's when it's still pulpy.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If the coconuts we get are so hard...

Yeah, if they take an old, mature coconut they call it, they will grate it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And
then wring it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Through a cloth?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Like a muslin cloth.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If the coconut is starting to rot a little bit, is it still good to eat?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, I just...two that I made today, I let some go yellow."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Start the
fermentation, rotting process."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because I loved coconut as a child, but it was
always steamed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So I need to clean a lot of that out.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So every once in a while
I'll eat some rotten coconut to help cleanse it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But the Mayans and the Aztec
used spoiled coconut to help bowel problems and digestive problems."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It ferments, doesn't it?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Well there's not a lot of sugar in it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's mostly fat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So it's not necessarily
a fermentation."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There is some sugar that will ferment in it, but it starts
breaking down the fats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Creating a bacteria in it, and that's what will help the
intestines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","How do you determine how much clabbered milk...

That's going to vary, but I would suggest that you have a quart a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It won't congest me?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because I always have constant...

You're going to have that because you're so dry."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you had the cream to drink,
everything would just relax everywhere."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Sounds good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Look forward to that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Definitely.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you buy extra milk and just suck the cream off the top with a
straw like I do, because I need the cream, I have to have it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Aajonus, milk that is...?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Clareville.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Raw milk.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","All throughout...

All of that's pasteurized."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","We don't have raw milk that's organic...

...organic but pasteurized."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They separate them, they pasteurize them
separately, and they combine them back together."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's why the cream's on the
top."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The only thing I can find in this county is raw cheese.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Clareville milk.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's in Sacramento.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh, really?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",One person drives to Sacramento each week.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, but you don't have to do it every week, because milk, let's say you leave
in the refrigerator, and leave it out to clabber, I keep milk up to 3 weeks at a
time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's not a problem.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","In fact, the more spoiled, the better."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I need to go, can I...

Yes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Your name again?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Sandra.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Sandra.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Relax.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, very overactive sex glands, Sandra, you're a naughty
girl."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",They've been active for a long time.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They are active, it's just that they're making up for the low adrenals that you
have."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",This adrenal gland doesn't look like it's working at all.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","This one looks
like it's working a little bit, but it can't keep up."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you're substituting
your sex hormones for your absence of adrenaline."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Very low thyroid on this side,
parathyroid's fine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The glands in your throat are good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Here also.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The thyroid's
shape is okay, but it's not producing well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The parathyroid on the right side is
very overactive again."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So you have hypothyroidism.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'm not a doctor, I can't
diagnose, but this is what it looks like in hypothyroidism."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Pancreas looks
debilitated over here, probably 25% active on that side and maybe 20% active on
this side."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",This side's drying up and debilitating more than this side.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","This
side's more edemic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",This ovary is starting to debilitate a bit.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Very toxic
minerals in it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And in the left.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",More in the right.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Lots of toxic minerals
stored in the sinuses."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do you get headaches?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, but I have a chronic post-nasal drip."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'm surprised you don't have migraines with that one.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, I don't get headaches usually."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You're very fortunate.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Usually when I see this condition, these people have
either migraines or cluster headaches."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",There's toxic minerals there?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Toxic metals.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's a concentration, like it could be mercury from fillings."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No,
it's a little bit more than that, because it goes so high up."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's mainly on the
left side."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, the left side."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Intestines – lots of scarring in the intestines, lots of AGEs stored in
there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Worse on the right side than the left. ...
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","kidney on the left, kidney is
full of scar tissue and fatty deposits."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",RBC count is okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Circulation and blood
temperature – blood pressure seems like it's okay, but blood temperature is
low."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Well I'm usually very hot.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I don't know if that has anything to do with it, but
I'm...hot all the time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Are you getting hot flashes?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, but they're not as often as before."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But still I'm always hot in the
summer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Or even before the summer comes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And in the winter?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'm warm, I don't get cold."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So this is just something that's happening right now?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'm not feeling cold.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I feel warm most of the time, too warm."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Sweat a lot.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I guess your hands are working as a radiator.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What about the rest of my body?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's very warm.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And your hands are just ice cold.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",My feet do that for me.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So
the RBCs look like they're carrying oxygen well, everything's fine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You're not
digesting fats well at all."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So how could you...I eat so much fats, that I don't digest fats...You recommend
fat, a lot of fat...

Well, if you're eating raw fats, and you need proteins to digest them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You're
not assimilating the proteins that you've been eating to utilize your fats
properly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Once you start eating the right raw fats, you'll be able to digest the
fats that you are eating."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I would say stabilize for about 3.5 months before
you go on the detox program."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It doesn't mean you'll gain more, you'll probably
lose some."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But I want you to lose a lot.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Gonna recommend 6-8 eggs a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Before you do that, what about my liver?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Liver isn't in great shape.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Isn't?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, it has scarring in it, it has some rupturing in it, hemorrhaging in it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Any mineral deficiency?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, you are mineral deficient in all of your minerals."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because you've eaten
so many cauterized, from cooked foods."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So you're deficient in all minerals.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And
that's what the juice will help you with."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'm going to recommend that you have
10% carrot juice, 80% celery, and 10% parsley."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That should help stimulate your
adrenal glands a little bit better and bring your body temperature down a bit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you're going through heat prostration in the summer, have ½ grapefruit with
some coconut cream, about 3oz of coconut cream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And that'll help the heat
prostration."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I recommend that you try to eat 12oz of meat a day, and then
through a period of about 1 year and 3 months, work up to a pound."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Various
meats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You need a lot of red meat at first.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'd say 75% red meat, and 25% white."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Split that up ...fish or chicken.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And then after about 18 months, then you can
lower the amount of red meat and increase the amount of white meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Not by much,
maybe only 5%."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You need red meat for a long time.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Lots of red meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That juice,
I would take for about 7 weeks."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Then eliminate the carrot juice and add 10% more
parsley for another 3 weeks."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Then lower the celery to 70% and have 10% zucchini
or summer squash, and then 20% parsley."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","One day a week, substitute your one cup
of regular juice, one cup of the quart, for one whole cup of white cabbage."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Straight, one cup of cabbage...?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, don't drink it all at one time, you might have a lot of gas from it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So
just sip it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Have it all at one time, but sip it over a 20-minute period, not
mixed with anything else."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Some almost thrombotic type reactions going on in your
body with varicose veins."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And it's a severe vitamin K and U deficiency.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And the
cabbage will help bring it back."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But you need it in a concentrated amount one
day a week."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Probably in about 2 or 3 years down the line you could incorporate
it into your juice on a daily basis."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But right now you don't want to start
detoxing those toxins right now."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You want to concentrate on that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","A lubrication
formula, at the top of page 163, when the butter is available, have that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How often?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh, I would have it as the last meal before your last juice in the day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You
could have it with the fish or chicken, in the evening."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Have it in the evening,
only once a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Last meat meal.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do you have any questions?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yes, what about eggs and milk?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I said you need about 6-8 eggs a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Milk – as much as you like.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You would
do better by clabbering it, because you're very low in enzymes in the intestinal
tract."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And the clabbering will help take care, predigesting it for you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What about honey?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Have that as you like it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And fruit, you didn't mention fruit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because even though your pancreas is working, you've got varicose veins and
developing thrombosis."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And fruit will cause more swelling and rupturing, so I
really suggest that you limit the fruit if you're going to have it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What about pineapple?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",If you're going to have small amounts.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Let's say you had ¼” circular slice,
half of that, once a day, with cheese or cream or something like that, be okay."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But I wouldn't have it every day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'd have it every other day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Otherwise you're
gonna have swelling there and any swelling is gonna cause rupturing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And more of
a development of that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Maybe in a couple of years.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'm giving everybody what I see is the optimal for them.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You do what you're
going to do."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",May I be next?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I've gotta go pretty soon.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'm sorry.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How many do I have yet to do?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Seven.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",They're all sweaty.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Laurie.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I pronounced it correctly?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Laurie?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Laurie, what an artist you are."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Whoa, some
control issues there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Probably...

What do you mean probably?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I've got all parts.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The left ovary is debilitating a little bit.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Shrinking.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The right is okay,
fine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The adrenal glands are normal.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I would expect them to be very overactive.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",With as thin as you are.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But they're not.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Left side of the pancreas is almost
completely debilitated."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Less than probably 5% functional, on the left side."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Right side, maybe 10-15% functional."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Mostly debilitated.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So it looks like a
diabetic-type pancreas."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So, fruit I would say, only if you absolutely have to."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","RBC count is very good, excellent."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So concentrate on maybe 50% red meat for a
while until the liver is rebuilt."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You've got a lot of blood going into the
liver."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Usually means that the liver is needing a lot of nutrients, good supply
of nutrients."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Also usually means that you're producing a lot of bile, and using
bile in place of good fats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Which irritate and break down the system.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Gonna
recommend that you have your carbohydrate rather than in fruit juice, you have
10% carrot juice as part of your juice."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So 10% carrot juice, 70% celery, and 20%
parsley."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now you'll also have a huge amount of bile come out through your skin,
and you're gonna get very yellow, and green, and brown at times."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Thyroid seems
to be very good, both parathyroids are very low."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not very active at all.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Tonsil
on the left side looks okay."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The right side, it's debilitated."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Do you have your
tonsils?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I don't know.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do you get sore throats on the right side at all?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Earaches on the right?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not really.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's very unusual, with this pattern here."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, now that you're getting good
food, you might start cleaning out those areas, because it's very debilitated."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The parathyroids on the right side are very debilitated and toxic.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You have the
appearance of arthritis developing in the joints."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Kidney is fat-congested.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's just the left kidney.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The right kidney looks like it's not functioning.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The end of it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So I recommend the honeycomb for you too.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Eating the wax with the
honey."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Would help.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",At least a quart of clabbered milk a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","About 6-10 eggs a
day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I recommend that 4 of them be rocky-style.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Ugh...

That's a recommendation."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","A lot of people that have your feeling about
that, usually they poke a hole in both ends and then suck a little at a time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's easier to eat that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Sometimes somebody has your kind of repulsion, if they
have the whole egg and try, they can't get it down."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It wants to come back up.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So
you just take a little bit at a time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's easier.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And you don't have to look at
the whole globby mess."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And it's inside the egg you're sucking out.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You never get
to see the egg."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's easier.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I think that would be harder to do it that way.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I don't think so.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Give it a try.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Coconut cream's gonna be very important to help get rid of this joint toxicity
that you have."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It could develop into arthritis.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I do a lot of that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And also eat some whole coconut.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Circulation's good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No real congestion
too much anywhere."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Let me see your eyes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You have scarring in your muscles.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Were
you a dancer, or athlete, at all?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Active kid.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And your lymph system is pretty clogged.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I would suggest, as I suggested for
one other person, a few slivers of pineapple twice a week for you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Just a couple
of them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",To help break down that lymph congestion.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Coconut cream will help with
that a lot."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So when you have the pineapple, have the coconut cream and the
pineapple together."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And I suggest that you have that with some chicken or fish.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Or even beef.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Once a week.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","One of the times that you have the two wedges or
pieces of pineapple with coconut, one time have it with chicken preferably, and
another time with beef."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Chicken, you have a hard time with chicken, I can tell."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I haven't even begun...

Ha ha."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I recommend at least 4 cups of juice a day, a quart a day, probably
more."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You're going to need a little bit of water.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Probably ½ cup a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I hope
that's not somebody's stomach."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",His pager.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Oh.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",His vibrator.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",He's taking care of himself.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I like that joke.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What about my lungs?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They're not in real good shape, there's a green cast to it, almost like there's
some gangrene."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I haven't brought it up because I'm still trying to figure
out what it's from."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Well I have smoked off and on for 10 years various things.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Like marijuana and crack, or...?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well not crack, but marijuana, DMT, …, cloves,... different things."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well the only way I can...

...Okay."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's the tissue that was substituted there better unless...

Well I'm...

The lung."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Oh really?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Really.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That'll make a big difference.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I was a heavy smoker.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I smoked 2
packs a day of lucky strikes, no filter."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And I smoked them down to the very end.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I would burn my fingers.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",My mother called me a fiend.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I started about 13
years old, until I was 24."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The hardest thing for me to give up.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","My lungs are
still full of scar tissue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",My bronchials.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So, but I had some lung of a buffalo
last week, actually on Tuesday, when arrived, and I took the milk, and blended
it with it with a little teaspoon of salsa."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It was the best gland I've ever had.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",With that salsa.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And it was delicious.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The next day...I had it that night.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And
the next day, I felt like I was absorbing and utilizing all of the oxygen I was
breathing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And I haven't felt that since...probably never.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So it's really
delicious."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And he brought some.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They're gorgeous, they're pink and lavender, and
(maven?)."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",A beautiful gland.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's the most beautiful gland.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",In a healthy animal.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It didn't smoke.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Maybe its parents smoked.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, so, eat lung, and chicken's the best way
to remedy that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That usually means 2 or 3 spells of pneumonia in your lifetime.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That kind of gangrenous look.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I had like (plurothy?)
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",type thing once.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",When I was little.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And you probably took antibiotics to prevent it?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I took antibiotics once, maybe once in my lifetime."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Fortunate.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Wow.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Well then probably those 3 times won't be so traumatic.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You have any questions?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Don't think so.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'm gonna tell you a little incident about...everybody knows what multiple
myeloma is?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's cancer of the blood and bone.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's what I had.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I just looked at the
statistics a month ago."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The survival rate is 0.0001.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's what I had.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Had a
client about 1.5 years ago that was in fourth stage."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","She'd been in that for four
years, or had had been diagnosed after 4 years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Had had lots of medical
treatment, was on her death bed, had not been out of the bed in about 1.5-2
years, something like that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","She'd had pneumonia 2 times before I saw her, in the
6 weeks before I saw her."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","She didn't tell me that, and I told her that she'd
probably gonna have to go through pneumonia because it was a condition I saw in
the lungs, the lungs were in, the bronchials."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And she says 'well I just went
through it twice in the last 6 weeks.'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And she says 'If I hadn't gone to the
hospital, I would've died.'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And I said 'That's your belief.'
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I said 'But if
you'll go through, if you'll bear with it, and even though you think you're
going to die, say “it's okay to die”."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Take your chances.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because your only
shot is, to get through it and get well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And if you take the antibiotics, and
stop it, there's no progression toward well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",There's only more convalescing.'
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And I said 'You're already in bed.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How would you not like to be able to talk?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Or
breathe without a respirator?'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I said 'That's the way you go, every time you
stop pneumonia."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Or bronchitis, any of them.'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So sure enough, 10 days later, she
got pneumonia."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And it was do or die.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",She was gonna get through it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There were
moments during the nighttime when it usually hits the worst, when the nervous
system is detoxing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That she just thought she wasn't going to be able to take
another breath, and that was it, and she was gonna die."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","She got through it in 3
days and was out of the bed first time in 1.5-2 years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And everybody was all
around her freaking her out, scaring her, but she stayed strong, and got through
it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Gordon.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Hi Gordon.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, very overactive sex glands."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Very overactive.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Adrenals are
pretty normal."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The right one's a little overactive.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Was.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There's fatigue in both
of them right now."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The pancreas, the left side, is about 90% debilitated, a
little bit of inflammation, a little bit of edema."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The right side is about 15%
active."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",With edema and inflammation.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I would treat yourself as if you were
diabetic and have very little fruit, once maybe every 4-5 days."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","4 days is
probably about right."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You do need a little fruit.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So probably every 4 days would
be best."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Any particular recommendation on that?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You need some kiwi, when you can get it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Berries – very good for you.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Any of
the berries."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Strawberries not as much, but raspberries, mulberries, blueberries,
blackberries, boysenberries, any of those."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And when you have them, have a little
cheese before you start eating them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Have some with coconut cream.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Other creams
– milk, avocado once in a while."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Liver's not in good shape.

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The
left one's okay."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Circulation on the left side of your spine isn't that great.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Some kind of stomach problem.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Mm hm.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Looks like probably 60% of the stomach is scar tissue in the duodenum.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Where would that come from?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Probably your body not manufacturing mucous properly to coat the stomach, and
the acids and compounds from eating, eating away at the stomach."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And just kept
getting scarred, scarred, and scarred over the years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I recommend that you have
about 70% red meat, 30% white for maybe 6 years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You have some very toxic
compounds in your sinuses."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Long-term exposure or more...?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",This is very long-term.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But it could be also present because it looks like it's
active right now."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Or it's coming out.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Any particular compound you can identify?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, it looks red in your system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And as it lodges in the tissues, it's
causing a green and purple."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now this is independent, I throw some carrots and some beets sometimes in my
juice mix, that coloration you're seeing is independent of that coloration?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No no, that's not toxic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Unless it's pulling out some metal toxicity.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You have
just a lot of fat congestion everywhere."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So it isn't that you have bad fat
digestion, you have bad fat assimilization and utilization."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I would suggest that
you drink your urine after a meat meal twice a week."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Mid-stream or full?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Full.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","About 10-15 minutes after you eat meat, I suggest you have about 1 tbsp
of honey."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's any kind of meat, red or white?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, any kind."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You have some good instincts going with the beet juice, I
usually don't recommend beet juice because it cuts down bacteria levels."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But if
you mix some beet juice with some coconut cream, at the time you're going to
drink it, not pre-mix it, and that would be like 1tsp of beet juice to about
3tbsp of coconut cream, and you have that with either chicken or fish, that will
help you utilize the fats properly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And to break those down that didn't get
utilized properly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And specifically coconut cream rather than milk cream?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You will not have the same reaction of beet juice with cow's cream.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I
suggest maybe 5-6 cups of milk a day, preferably clabbered."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You need lots of
high meats, high fish, clabbered milk, need lots of bacteria."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Usually when I see
this kind of...there's a lot of depression involved."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And that's because bacteria
levels are low."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Not all the bacterias, but just certain ones."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And they're mainly
for fats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So fish is a good high fat that can grow a lot of bacteria in it,
quickly, chicken also."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because the oil's permeated in them.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It isn't sectioned
off in marbling."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So those 2 high meats would be preferable for you.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","At least a
quart of juice a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","80% celery, 20% parsley, but per quart, use ½ small lemon
or lime."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Juiced, the rind and all."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's what I was gonna say.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When you're on a
detox routine, add 1/3 of a lemon or lime per quart, rind and all, it'll help
you lose the weight quicker."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",A quart of...?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Vegetable juice.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You juice it with the rest of the vegetables.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",When you're on the lose weight...?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Lose weight cycle, yeah."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Per quart, you said?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yes, per quart."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yours is more.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And you have it at all cycles, for about 6
months."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",There's some days you can take off if you don't want it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But 5 days a
week."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I would say you need 6 eggs a week with red meat, so 2 eggs at a time with
some red meat, so 3 meat meals a week with red meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Steak tartare there.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Red
onion would be very good for you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I've had an allergy, or an intolerance to red onion, it can make me very ill."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What's the extent?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I get first a burning sensation and all my energy drops out, I become very very
weak."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",For how long?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If I get a piece the size of my fingernail, it can knock me out for a day,
maybe two."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Red's the worst for me.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And with what were you eating it?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Depends...any form...if it was cooked I don't have as much reaction, but raw,
in any form, any place I would get it raw, it wouldn't matter what it's with, as
far as I know."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I haven't tried, I haven't experimented with different things,
but for example, in a salad or just by itself."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","In fact I avoid any kind of onion or things in the Allium family, scallions,
white, whatever."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What about garlic?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I can tolerate garlic.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But it doesn't do the same.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'll just have to skip that then, because you do
have a blood problem with that acid."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Trying to see if there's something else
that can do the same thing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Have you ever tried just a little bit with raw
cheese?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Blended?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I've never tried that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'd be willing to try it once.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","On a day when I know I'm
not gonna have to go to work."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What I'd like you to do is only take a section about like this,
I mean a piece, square like that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And use this much cheese, and blend it with an
egg."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Blend it all together.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And see if you have a reaction.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Can I just blend it with a fork?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Oh no.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You need to blend that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because you need those acids that you're having
a problem with in your blood, because it's in your blood that it's happening,
and that's why it's fatiguing you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","For some reason it's causing your red blood
cells to rupture."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Like it's almost like that sickle cell anemia.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's almost
identical to that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Maybe you have some black heritage there.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I don't think so, no."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not that I know of.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Right.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Anyway, it's not identical to that, but it's similar to that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And
that's the reaction you're getting from...

That explains why it's so violent, I felt it as such a violent thing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So if you mix it with that, and then eat it with some meat, and you don't have
a reaction, it'll be fine, but you need all of those acids absorbed into the
cheese and the egg fats, so that it cannot get loosened into your system easily."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So it'll already be bound and arrested in fat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'll give it a try.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'd like you to call me and let me know.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Sure.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'll try to do it sometime in the next month.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Ha ha, it's a big risk."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because all you need is just a little amount like
that, about every 2 weeks."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Like a medicine.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","We'll try to get the medicine to
where it doesn't cause the side effect."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Cream will not do, it has to be cheese."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Cheese and egg.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So I don't take any cow cream at all?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You can, but I mean with that onion, it's cheese and egg."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",For a meat sauce.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I
didn't describe it, I showed you a thumb size, my thumb size."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So it's like maybe
2 of your first joint of your thumb, that much cheese."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Blend it with one egg.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And 1/4” by 1/4” cube of one thin slice of red onion.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now you say it happens
with the red onion but not the yellow and white?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Red is the worst, the next would be white, the next would be yellow, and the
least would be scallions, although I still react."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But it's in that order.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How about chives?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Chives, again I can tolerate in very small quantities, if I get a few, it's
okay."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, do it with the yellow onion."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How about leeks?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Again, very tiny quantities."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Too much and it's a problem.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Shallots...

Yea yea, we got the point."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Also shellfish would be very good for you.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I've been eating raw scallops about once a week.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Great.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Good good good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Good instincts.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, do you have any questions?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yes I do.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I have problems with my eyes, first I'm kind of an eye-strained
company with developing far-sightedness, but I also have a serous retinopathy in
my right eye."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And it's an ongoing problem where I have a slight rupture and the
serous fluid leaks behind the retina and creates a bulge."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I'm wondering if
there's anything I can specifically do to try to address that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, put the egg white in your eye."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Two times a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","At least once a day, but
twice a day would be more helpful."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The eyes get nutrients so delayed, and it's
last usually, in the cycle of where food goes chain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So that's why putting it
directly into the eye helps."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So that will actually internally affect the retina?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because it'll be absorbed into the white tissue, and even under, it'll be
absorbed, in the tissue of the eye lids."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And then the body can process and
utilize it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you're feeding it twice a day there, it will help the internal
protein."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Red meat, like I said earlier, is important to stabilize the eye
condition for some reason."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So eating red meat will help that a lot.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Red meat and
chicken together."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Or red meat and fish together.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That would also promote it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The
healing of it quicker."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Anything else?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I have some cardiac arrhythmia.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Look right here.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The heart tissue looks fine.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But the lymph glands all around
the heart are just very congested."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",All the way out to the skin and bones.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So
it's basically a fat block."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So it's all related to this...

...this fat, not utilizing your fat properly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And the last thing is, on intuition I've been juicing chard and beet greens
along with my juice mix."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Any reason why I shouldn't do that?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","As long as they're greens, fine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's not recommended, just the beet root...?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Well the beet root has the high HCL in it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And that's what destroys it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The
stalk doesn't have that kind of concentration of HCL."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What about oxalic acid?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You mean in spinach?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, juicing spinach."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's not a thing I recommend very often.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because that's an antibacterial one.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Isn't that in beets also?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yea.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And chard too.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","For some reason I'm craving, wanting to do it, should I avoid
that instinct?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, no."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You'd have to have it in a very large quantity.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Chard doesn't have the
same reaction like beets do."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And garlic will also have a heavy reaction toward antibacterial, so you should
use it as a flavoring."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I love garlic, but if I have garlic, my blood pressure
shoots up, and I can't sleep, and I get horny as hell."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I will just take a
thin slice and blend it in something, and it permeates the flavor, and still I
feel like I'm eating a lot of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Most people, it lowers their blood pressure."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Me, it raises mine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What about ginger, is that also antibacterial?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yes, it is antibacterial."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I don't mind using it on the skin very much, but it
does help break down certain fats, it is something that you could use once in a
while, some ginger."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Some people have an allergic reaction to it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The best way to
have it – if you're going to have ginger and use it in that way, if you do not
have an ill reaction, is to make an ice cream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ginger ice cream.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And that's
taking one egg, 5oz of cream, 1 tbsp of honey, and ½ tsp of ginger is all it
takes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ginger juice?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, ginger juice."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Aajonus, I put the ginger in my (…?)"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",for taste.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Is that a good idea?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Just a
little bit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yes, you have a lot of fat congestion."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Definitely.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because that's your main
problem."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Two of you have similarities there.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",We both can take ginger?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","… it, or should I really juice it?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You need it mixed with those things.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because that could cause an ill reaction.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You just answered one of my questions.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Probably 2 months ago I started
consuming a lot of ginger, and, just when you said, it's like 'aha!'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","About 2
months ago my intestinal problems got a lot worse, the gas problem."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I'm
really disturbing it...already disturbed...

Environment, yes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So the ginger, eggs, cream, honey mix is what...?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",All together.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You can just make that mix, I mean it's like an ice cream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you were to add ½ tsp of carob to that, it would be like gingerbread ice
cream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I love that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Delicious.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It doesn't even have to be frozen.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You add carob, is that what you said?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, about ½ tsp of carob to that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I love gingerbread ice cream.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, next."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",He wants to stay and get as much information as he can get.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Overactive sex glands.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You need a partner or play with yourself.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Circulation is
good all over."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Lots of youth hormones.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's why you're reacting so quickly.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Usually I don't see this kind of youth hormone except in somebody under 15.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You're very fortunate.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's creating so much radiance that I can't see as many
of your problems."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Severe congestion in your intestines.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And looks like spleen,
lots of scarring in it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",There's almost no bacteria in your intestines at all.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I drink almost a gallon of milk a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Really.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's not gonna do anything.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Unless it's clabbered.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What you need is, get some
good high meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Rotten meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Rotten chicken would be the best for what you need.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Rotten fish and rotten chicken.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How about rotten deer?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You can do that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What you might do is take some tripe, some deer intestines,
and eat that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That'll probably reconstitute from that intestinal damage that you
have."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Probably reconstitute it quicker.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Lungs, you've got some damage in the
lungs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Heavy metal toxicity in the right lungs.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And also the sinuses.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","On the
right side."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Metal toxicity all through the mucous membranes in the throat up.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What were you doing?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You name it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You did everything?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because you have lots of metal toxicity too.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Lots of
solvents, lots of chemicals, paint."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'm going to recommend that you have 60%
celery, 20% zucchini, or summer squash, and 20% parsley."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","1/3 of a lime per quart
of juice, rind and all."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I suggest 1.5 tbsp of honey with your juice, per quart."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Were you a smoker?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because the smoking is related to kidney damage.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Does your left kidney back
here, ever give you any soreness?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It used to hurt all the time.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But not since the diet.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When you start getting rid of some of that scar tissue in there, it's
gonna hurt again, so...

In my lungs?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'm talking about the kidney right now.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because the kidney is in pretty bad
shape."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The left one.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you're going to have fruit, I suggest you have berries."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Any kind of berry.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Cheese, cream, coconut cream, avocado."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Avocados, you're not
going to digest more than 3 a week."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Really?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I gotta cut back.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I love avos.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You need to eat at least 1lb of meat a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Anywhere from 50-60% red meat, and
40-50% white meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","To help reconstitute those intestines, you're gonna need that
fowl."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So I gotta do a bird?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'm ready for your fowl recipe book.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The recipe that I gave earlier with the coconut, tomato, and lime juice,
coconut cream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I did that one with the cabbage.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, no cabbage."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Who told you to add cabbage?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I thought I got it from your book.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",A Polynesian recipe.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, I don't have...I didn't have it in my book."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","At least I don't remember
putting it in my book."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Maybe I did.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Iceberg lettuce.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",From Moorea.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, iceberg lettuce is not cabbage."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Cabbage will create gas and all kinds of
ill reactions."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It interferes...

I did that, it was very good."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I don't recommend much lettuce in that, that's a very small amount, just diced
up in there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Otherwise it'll over-alkalinize it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The lime, it kind of, they
balance each other, when you have a small amount."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So did you have chicken that
way?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It was good?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It was good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It was very good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, so just have more."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Anywhere from 1-2 quarts of milk a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","With
the intestines in that shape, I would say definitely clabbered."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","90% of it
clabbered."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You could use some ginger too, because you have some fat clotting."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That may have changed, looks like it's changed since you started the diet, so
you won't have any trouble building any more of that, but the ginger will help
get rid of the old stuff that's clogged in your system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Especially all around
the intestines, you have these clots."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Toxic fat congested clots.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I can see it in my eyes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The little fat rosary beads, they were around the
outside...

That's the lymph."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",...they're moving to the inside.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well that rosary means that you're at the brink of lymphoma, so if that's
going away, that's great."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, do you have any questions?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, is it okay to put lemon juice on my deer?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Aww, it's my quick lunch."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you put lemon or lime juice, or pineapple, with red meat, it will
turn it into a pyruvate to be burned as a fuel."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Instead of utilized for
regeneration of tissue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What if you're about to go do like 3 hours of intense exercise?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What would you
eat before you went?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Or during?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When I did that for 1.5 years of my life, when I did some exercise, I ran
anywhere from 5-13 miles a day, I did 250 push-ups with my feet at least this
high off the ground, and then I did 30-50 handstand push-ups."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That was when I
first started eating lots of fats and meats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The first time of my life I felt I
could do something."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It was hard getting into exercise, because I had never been
able to exercise."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But when I would do that, I would always suck 2 eggs before I
went."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What's the difference between a blended egg and a sucked egg?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When you blend an egg, you mean without anything in it?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If I take 3 eggs and put them in a blender, and then I...

With?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",All by themselves.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You oxidize some very important proteins that can no longer be utilized
properly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",When it's blended?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yes, when it's blended."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you have cream in it, coconut cream, milk, it coats
the proteins so that they don't oxidize."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And if you're blending it in a small
container where there's not much air, it'll even reduce it more."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Even if you have it right away, it's still oxidized?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The oxidizing is when the air passes into it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So it's better not to put them in a blender then?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Aajonus, how can you tell if somebody has a really poor constitution?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Poor constitution?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, it depends on where."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Like many years ago I had somebody look into my eyes, and he said that I had a
serious problem, but I also had bad genetics, and...So I guess I was wondering
if these things you can see, or...

Well, yeah, that's when I take a look at you, I can see, the degree of
debilitation in your system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now let's say your eyes are supposed to be blue or
green, and they're brown."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And you were born that way, that means that you came
in with a poor constitution."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you came in with lesions or scar tissue, that
means you came in with a poor constitution."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But all that is reversible?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",All of it's reversible.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I came in basically with diabetes like 5 of my cousins.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And they all started insulin from about 8 years old on it, definitely between 8
and 15 years old."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And I completely reversed mine.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Are onions antibacterial?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yes, but I just use them for flavoring, just a small amount."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I have another question.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When I was born, the hip bones were out of the
sockets, so I had surgery, and although I can walk, and I'm walking fine, I have
this pain on my right side that happens."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Can this diet correct or help this?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, but it takes 7.5 years to replace every cell in the bones."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And it takes 5
generations to do that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So it could take up to 40 years to remedy that
completely."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now, both of my femur joints were almost completely gone from the
bone cancer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So I couldn't walk.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I rarely have pain any more, and I'm only
20 years into it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Michael.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Michael.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Say your last name so we know.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Rhodes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay Michael, very overactive sex glands, they're debilitating."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Again, I see a
condition where it looks like...were you a vegetarian for quite a while?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Long time.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How many years?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",25.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",There's no stable protein anywhere in your body.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You're very fragile.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Very
frail."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Like the other lady here that was that long.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You're in a little bit
better shape."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Relax your hand.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",There you go.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Both thyroids are inactive.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The
right parathyroid is somewhat active."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The left is barely.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There's lots of
swelling in the throat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",In those glands in the throat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Did you have your tonsils
removed?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","This one looks okay, but this one looks like it's debilitated."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And scarred.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I have throat...problems with my voice, losing my voice, would that be related?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's a gland, it's trying to deal with the toxicity around."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And it keeps
trying to drain out your throat with mucous."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So that will affect your voice.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Any
time toxins pass out to the throat, it will affect the vocal chords, because the
mucous gets in the way of the chords."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You have no stable animal fats in your body.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So everything is very very
tenuous."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Any compound that is of an acidic nature will irritate your system.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Like her, I suggest, when you can get the cream and the butter, you eat a lot of
it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Until then, eat as many eggs as you can, and I suggest anywhere from 10 to
18 a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Lots of fish and beef and chicken.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you want to reverse some of this
quickly, I would say work up to eating 1.5-2lbs of meat a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I eat from 1 to
3."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And high meats?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","High meats, I would say, not for about 2.5 years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you have a little
depression, I'd say maybe, you might think about eating maybe a pill-size amount
of fecal matter to get your straight veritoxin right in there, to get the
bacteria full force, rather than something that still has to go through to break
it down in the meat, if you start with the high meats, you're gonna spend a lot
of time detoxifying, and you're gonna have no energy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You're too vulnerable, and
you have too much degenerative tissue that can be fed on immediately."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And
that'll put you into chronic fatigue for years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So what I suggest is you get
stable, you get strong, get some cells regenerated, and then in about 2.5 years,
start getting rid of some of that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But right now you can't afford to get rid of
anything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How about sunlight?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh, sunlight is very helpful."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","For everybody, sunlight is helpful."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Do you handle
sunlight okay?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Well I do now.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I used to get herpes sores, and sunlight would aggravate that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","...are detoxif...

You have a lot of swollen arteries and veins."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Like thrombosis, they've gotten
very watery."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because there's a lack of protein in them.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So that'll reverse with
lots of protein."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So I say you need 1-2 lbs a day of meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Juice – 90% celery,
10% parsley."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","For about 6 weeks, then lower it to 80% celery, 10% parsley and 10%
zucchini."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Every other week, in one day's juice, one quart, use 1/3 lime or ½
lemon, rind and all, in the juice."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That means juice with rind and all.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And where
do you live?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",… Grass Valley.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You need a lot of glandular help.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Thyroid, lungs, parathyroid, which are
attached."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So when you get the thyroid, you get the parathyroids with it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Testes,
you need some glands."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And that'll help you bounce back quicker.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Your
testosterone right now, and your overactive adrenals are basically what's
keeping you going."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Thank God you have that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because some people don't.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","In your
situation."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Like this young lady over here.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Who was there.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It still looks like
you have some growth hormone, which is something I usually don't see in
vegetarians, that have been vegetarians for a very long time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So it looks like
you could rebound better than most, on a good diet, like Michael."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I would
suggest that you drink some of your milk at an odd stage."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","When it goes just a
day old."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's got more of a bitter taste, but that particular enzyme and
bacteria is something you need."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So let some clabber 3 days, and let some just go
a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And kind of mix them.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So have 1-2 quarts a day, whatever you like."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But
I'd focus more on the meat, than I would on the milk."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because if you eat a lot
of milk, you're not gonna crave as much meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Sometimes concentrate on the milk,
and sometimes concentrate on the meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Predominantly the meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, any
questions?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How about homemade sauerkraut?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's great if you want to lower bacteria levels.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You don't need that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You
needed it while you were a vegetarian to keep the bacteria levels down because
you have so much degenerative tissue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That if you started bacterias feeding on
your system to degenerate it, you'd go into chronic fatigue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Homemade sauerkraut
will prevent that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You don't get well.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But of course you don't get stronger.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And
you'll have a certain amount of fatigue but at least you won't bottom out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I
suggest do not do it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And avocado?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No more than 4 a week.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Does it take the presence of growth hormone to allow regeneration, and without
it are you basically just gonna...?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, usually in the meat, when it's raw, it has growth hormone activity in it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you have your own, it magnifies it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Like lucky guys like this.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So what did you say, growth hormone or youth hormone?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Growth hormone.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Same thing.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But the idea is that for the various folks here who have had places where
there's been organs which have degenerated significantly, the raw meat is the
single biggest thing that's going to help to regenerate?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Correct.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And if they eat the gland that's degenerated from an animal, it will
increase that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So for example should I be eating stomach?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Like I told...didn't I tell you?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Who was it?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You mentioned that...

I told you to eat tripe."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Eat stomach.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Tripe is the intestines.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You need
intestines and some stomach."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So where do you get intestines?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",See this man.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",He's got the connection up here.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",He's the man with the glands.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But if you don't have access to organs regularly, then is the single best next
thing is...

is any of the meats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yup.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Red or otherwise?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, if it's an organ, it's usually white meat like chicken, turkey."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If it's a
gland like the liver, the spleen, and the pancreas and the muscles, it's mainly
red meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Will build them faster.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Next.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Jennifer.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Can we pump up light at all?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, let me use this."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do I need to hold the rim?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, that's okay."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because I've got to move it where I need it to be moved.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Thank
you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The spine looks like it's improving.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The left ovary isn't but the right
one is."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The parathyroids are looking better, the thyroid still isn't."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's
stabilizing, but it's just not functioning well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So that's probably... you still
have fatigue because of that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, I do."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So do you think it's a good time to do moldy regimen, or still go
with the fresh?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You mean the rotten meats?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Of the thyroid, particularly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No because it's building, and that's really what I wanted you to do was build,
first."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And then when it's functioning we can do the rotten glands to get it
broken down."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You still have anemia.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do you get out in the sun at all?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I have been a lot more now.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You need about 70% red meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",For about 6 weeks.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, this is an odd one."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I want you to have, I'm going to suggest that you have 60% celery, 20% parsley,
and ½ orange, rind and all, per quart, do this for 3 weeks only."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What is that for, particularly?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'm trying to figure it out.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Sometimes some things come intuitively, and I'm
trying to figure out why."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Has to do with your lungs, your liver, and your
pancreas and spleen."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There are certain resins from cooked vegetables that have
collected in that area, and they're like crystals."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The oils in the rind, when
combined with the acids in the juice, and in the high mineral content in the
rest of the juice, in the vegetables, will combine to help, looks like free up
those crystals."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Trying to see if it's going to dissolve it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Doesn't look like it
can be dissolved, it looks like they're stone."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",They're actually like jewels.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Not
precious being there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Far from it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Pretty.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But not helpful.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Your body's gonna
try to pass them, like stones, out of the gall bladder."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you may have some
cramping and some pain within 6 weeks after that 3-week period."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So have the pain
formula handy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's a lot of sugar, you may get emotional during that period."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The orange juice?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Oh great.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I've been trying to get away from that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah I know.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I would say, try to have like 3-4oz of cream within 20 minutes
after having the juice."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, 2-3oz each time, which is a lot of cream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You just
have to go down to Clareville and get some, for that 3 week period."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And sour
cream is wonderful."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I wanted to ask you how to do that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Is it just outside the fridge, you just
let...?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, I let it sit inside,...well if you want sour cream, you can leave it in the
fridge for about a month, sours beautifully."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You can leave it up to 3 months if
you like."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now I've had it up to 5 months and it's still delicious, so...beyond
that I couldn't tell you because I haven't let any sit for more than 5 months."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Were you going to say something about the sour cream for me, or something?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, I'm just saying that you can utilize cream even if it's sour."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But I
wouldn't have any other fruit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Is a date a fruit?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",High sugar.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Definitely.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Even though it's high in niacin and high in
minerals to help bind with the sugars so they're aren't used so rapidly, it
still can create emotionality."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's the only thing I would change, Jennifer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Great.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Here, I wanted to show you something."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Remember I cut my finger
rather severely and I did the mud."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Just lately the nail is turning white right
at the bottom."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I don't know if you can see it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's here.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I didn't know if, I
think the circulation and things are okay."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's fine.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's healing?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Probably just scar tissue being built in to that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because that's the way you can build out the scar tissue and get rid of it
quickly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I had a couple of other questions.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I still have...I seem to have tightness or
congestion right in here, in my small intestine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Is there anything you can
suggest...?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well that's just what I was saying, all that, those resins, they're locked in
there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I tend to feel dehydrated, even though I'm drinking, that's just...

You're so dry, it's going to take you probably 6 years to feel non-dehydrated."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And for the kidney, you know my kidneys have been swelling up a lot and
going back down, and I wonder, could that be a reaction to any of the foods that
I'm eating?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Or do you think it's a detox?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's detox.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So not avocado, or milk, or anything?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And then, I've gained like 14lbs,
and I'm wondering how much further to go before losing weight."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You look very good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Should I go up like another 10?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Or something...?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yea, I would say 10, definitely."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And then I also have heart arrhythmia and palpitations.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's usually low protein level.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Thank you.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",My turn?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you want to go...

Go ahead."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh, Phil too."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And Ray.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Aajonus, on the juice, you said 60% celery, 20% parsley, and then ½ orange."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Does that make up for the,...what is that, 20%?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, whenever I add the orange, it's like don't even consider the percentage,
between...you'll just have a little extra juice."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Name?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Benjamin.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Benjamin.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Very overactive sex glands and adrenal glands.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Very overactive on the
right."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The sex gland on the right is about normal.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The one on the left is very
overactive."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Usually that means that you could be an athlete or somebody who's
physically involved in life, unless your other glands above your chest do not
function well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And your thyroid is under-active, both sides, your parathyroid is
overactive, on both sides, but really not functioning that well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The one on the
left is overactive, but not producing much."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It tries.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It looks like you still
have your tonsils?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, I had them removed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I think one's grown back.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Oh.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The right one.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yup.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Looks like the fat cells are clumping in your
intestines, in your liver, small and large intestines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's affecting your
spine, right in this area right here, looks like it's even causing some
hemorrhaging, some ulcers in there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I'm gonna recommend that you have, you
need to handle that, because if you go into spinal meningitis, when this is
going on, it could be a long time to recover."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'm going to suggest, if that
scares you, that's good, because I want you to take care of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Take a whole cup
of cabbage juice, the white cabbage, a day, 4oz at a time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","4 oz in the morning,
and 4 oz in the evening."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And the rest of your juice...

That's green?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",White?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Green cabbage and white cabbage are the same.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Just not the red cabbage.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Juice it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Blender?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, if you're going to blend it, then you need to strain it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You don't want the pulp?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Don't want the pulp.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Is blending better?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, I would like the pulp removed, so if you blend it, you have to put
some kind of cloth that takes the pulp out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And you wring out the juice.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","How much...

Champion, Green Life, any of those juicers."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do you have a juicer?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I have an Omega.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That'll work for cabbage.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It doesn't squeeze it out very well.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Well then you can take it and press it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I see.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Once,...just open your Omega up, and press it against the side, and
that'll squeeze out even more."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Or put it in a cloth and wring it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's what I
did in the old days."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Have you been a vegetarian?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not strict.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Omnivore.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You say not strict.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, I tried to have a healthy diet."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Uh-huh.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You're not reproducing...But that was cooked meat, of course, that you
were mainly eating?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because you're not...the connective tissue and the tendons are buckling
on you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Which means that you're storing scar tissue there, and you're losing
elasticity."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",White meat is best to remedy that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You're still a little anemic
though, I mean, your RBC count is good, but your RBCs aren't as strong as they
need to be."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Basically you have a pretty balanced system.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's just balanced low?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It just doesn't have the enzymes, everything it needs, and it has toxicity in
it, but there's nothing that is exceptionally out of whack, except that you're
not getting rid of the AGEs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The toxic sugars from cooked starches.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That is
stored in your body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And that's causing an acid reaction throughout.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","A high
sugar and acid reaction, so it's damaging the blood, it's damaging everything,
and causing swelling everywhere."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I do a lot of fruit juices.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well that'll certainly help clean it out, but it'll also damage you at the same
time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So, it'll also give you a hell of a craving for cheese and meats and fats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Or starches, if you eat cooked starches."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Like potatoes?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I don't care for potatoes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What about breads, and grains?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No...sprouts.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Sprouts.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That usually won't cause that, that'll usually cause more hunger."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","How
much vegetable juice do you do?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I have done a couple of quarts...

A day?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",For one meal.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And fruit juices in the morning, and peanut butter in between."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh, so there you're going after the nut butters to balance it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I knew
there was one food in there you had to go crazy over."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And none of those
nut butters are raw."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Even if they say “Raw”.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I make them myself.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Oh.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Great, good."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But like I say, they have that, even if you're making it
into a butter, it has the enzyme supressants, enzyme inhibitors, and the protein
inhibitors, so it's better to blend that mixture I suggested, and you won't have
to eat as much."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You'll be much more satisfied.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I suggest that you have 1-1.5
quarts of milk a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",A quart of the juice a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Along with the cabbage juice?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Extra.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So that's 5 cups a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And so, is that throughout the day, or just for one meal, or...?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, that's...you need to spread it out throughout the day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because if you have
a lot of juice at one time, you're going to urinate out most of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","After it
robs your blood of fats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I mean, the vegetable juice at least won't rob your
body of fats like the fruit juice will."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But you need to spread it out, so that
your body can absorb and utilize it without urinating it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What about apples?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Apples?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you're eating it with cheese, I would say it's okay, once in a
while."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I mean, your pancreas is okay."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There's a lot of debilitation on the left
side, but you can handle a piece of fruit a day, definitely."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","We were talking,
not a piece of fruit like this man, who's eating a whole pineapple a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'm
talking about what will fit in your palm half-closed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's a piece of
fruit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So any kind of fruit?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Kiwi, or...?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Whatever you like.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There's no real...well, like I say, you do have some fat
congestion, so pineapple once in a while, kiwi, basically whatever you're
attracted to, pears would be good for you also, when they're in season."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Banana?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Oranges?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Banana's not a great thing for you, it looks like...

I don't crave it but once in a while, but...

Well once in a while would be okay."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But oranges – like 3 big oranges a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I don't recommend having that much fruit.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's basically my mainstay – oranges.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The problem with that is, is that if you eat a lot of fruit like that, it's
going to alkalinize your digestive tract so much that you're not going to be
able to eat meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It will absolutely destroy your ability to eat meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Over a period of time?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Meaning?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Over a period of time that it's going to destroy my ability to process meat?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Or immediately?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Probably immediately.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because you're already doing that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So trying to eat meat
is going to be difficult."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You'll see, if you tried, let's say tomorrow...

I had a piece today, and I got cold."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, you're not digesting it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So what can I do to...?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You need to get on the vegetable juice, eat lots of eggs, let's say, to build
that, eat the meat, and let it clabber, because basically the fruit juice wipes
out the intestinal bacteria that handles meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And eggs and dairy.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So what you
need to do is have those, cut way back on the fruit juices, to build your
ability to digest, and I would clabber all of your milk."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",All of it?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",All of it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And how much per day?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",1-1.5 quarts.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What percentage of celery, per quart of juice, would you say?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I think I said 80% and 20%.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",20% parsley?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Peanut butter and honey, that combination?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, not peanut."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Peanuts have an enzyme that's very difficult in the whole
form."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You can have the peanut oil, with pecans or walnuts or pine nuts."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",With the milk?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, with cream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Or with peanut oil and the honey.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I have another question.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I have scar tissue that I've been trying to
figure out how to turn that back into muscle."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And also my brain, I have
neurolateral temporal lobe dysfunction and right hemisphere dysfunction."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Two
thirds of my brain doesn't work."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Well that's normal for everybody.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because it's so toxified?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because it's so toxic.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It debilitates my ability to function.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The best way to get rid of that scar tissue is to eat brain that...if you can
get brain from this gentleman, and let it rot a little bit, and then also eat
some healthy brain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Then the degenerative bacteria from the brain will go in and
help break up the toxic areas of brain, remove the scar tissue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Eating the
healthy brain will help restore it quicker."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",If you want to concentrate on brain.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Why are you alternating it?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because neurological tissue is so important.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Whenever I do anything for the
spine or brain, I will eat the high bacteria one, one day, and eat the healthy
one the next day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And I'll alternate them like that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And no more than, let's
say,..I'll take a calf's brain, which is probably about this big, size of a
softball or larger."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And I'll spend 5 days eating that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I'll let half of it
get high, and the other half not."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And the way I keep half of it from getting
high, is I put it in a jar where there's no air, and the one where I let it get
high, I put it in a big jar with a lot of air."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And that'll work quicker.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Also
eating olive oil with chicken."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You said red meat, I mean white meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",White meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Chicken is white meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Olive oil with chicken will help
dissolve some."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Bacteria like I said works faster, parasite works even faster."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But if you can get them to take in your system.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Have you had a lot of
antibiotics or anything in your system?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Probably some.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Penicillin.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Injections?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And antibiotics this last fall for the flu.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Don't do that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Don't do that anymore.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","All right, next."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Everybody's falling asleep here?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Phil wants to hear all the information.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If he came here, he's gonna take
it all."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Hi.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Hi Ray.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Relax your hands.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Are you eating a pound of meat a day?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, about."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Are you getting sunshine?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'm gonna recommend that you eat 70% red meat for a while.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The red cells are
getting healthier, but not healthy fast enough."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You said that last time too.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I know.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'm having the clay too,...

Do you have liver at all?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Probably that will bring it back quicker.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I try to have liver twice a week, so
about ½ lb a week minimum."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The pancreas is still very debilitated.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Swollen.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Adrenal glands are looking a little bit better.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Thyroid gland, left side, looks
like it's functioning."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Parathyroid's not.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Thyroid over here looks like it's
starting to heal."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Parathyroids are working.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Lymph glands in the neck are
working."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Are you having that nut mix at all?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I think you're lacking some starch.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I'd like you to have that once or twice
a week, that nut mixture I gave."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Can you remind me?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The ½ cup nuts, walnuts, pecans, or pine nuts, 2 tbsp honey, 3oz of peanut oil
or 3-4oz of raw cream or coconut cream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That needs to be blended?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Blend that for about 50 seconds.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And have that once or twice a week.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'd
say for about a 6-week period, not much chicken, focus on fish and beef, and
liver, as part of the beef."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Are you still having other kinds of clay other than
the Rosebud?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, just the Rosebud."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And how long have you been taking that?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Between 3 months.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Like a month after the last time I saw you.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, I suggest that you stop taking it for about 4 months completely."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's
created a lot of good bacteria in your system, but it's becoming too much."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And
then when you go back to it, have it only 2 days a week, for another 2 months."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And then take 4 months off again.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And do that pattern for about 6 years.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","2
months on, twice week, 2 months, off 4 months."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And you're letting it get moist,
it's already moist, and you're keeping it moist when you're eating it?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Not so much, I mean, it's a clay, it's Rosebod clay, so...

It's already moist?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, a little bit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, that's fine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Some people let it dry out, and then they eat it as a
powder, and that's exactly the opposite of what I want them to do."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I'm just
making sure that you're having it that way."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, what I'd like you to do, is take about 1 tbsp of kiwi and mash it with
2tbsp of banana, and 3 drops of lime juice."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I'd like you to mash that all
together, and have it with an 1” by 1.5” cube of cheese, Monterey or
Cheddar."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Monterey is a little bit preferable.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That is going to create a chemical
reaction in your blood that'll stop them from sticking together so much."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because
they're clumping, and when they're clumping, they're not able to get to the
capillaries as well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It helps circulation.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",This works like in energy and stuff?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It should help, yeah."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because the blood's not flowing properly, not utilizing
oxygen well, then your energy level is always going to be low."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So, see how
long...do that for about 6 months."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do it every day?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No no no no.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Do it 5 days a week for 2 weeks, then 3 days a week for 1 week,
and then 2 days a week for the rest of the 6 months period."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Are you able to gain weight?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",A little bit.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, he looks like he's got a little bit there, looks fine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I've been having 10-12 eggs a day for a while now.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And how much meat?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",About a pound.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",At times a little bit less.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I haven't really done much with high
meats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do you suffer depression at all?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The bacteria level looks pretty good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So that's not my concern, is
bacteria level."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's the clotting.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I mean the clumping of cells.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There may be 3
stages to getting it to where we want it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So this is the next 6 months stage.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But hopefully this will make a big break in it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What about even filling out more, you know, muscles, to fill out more?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Well you'd have to eat more meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You still have a lot of congestion in the
intestines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That could probably use a little bit more bacteria.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Also eating
tripe, if you can get it from Michael, when you're up in this area, once in a
while, you might let a little bit of that get ripe, that bacteria's completely
absent there, like you took lots of oral antibiotics at some point, or
de-wormers or something."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, when I was a kid, probably, I mean that's what people do."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Pretty destroyed on the left side.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But everything else is working out pretty
well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'm getting stronger.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's just that anemia, you've got an anemia that's hard to break."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I sometimes have blood in stool.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's hard at times.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You have low bacteria level in the colon and that's that scarring here.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So use
the clabbered milk to help encourage the...

Could be fun."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It isn't like some colonic where they're putting 5 gallons of
water in you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",This is a nice kefir.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It actually is very soothing.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Kefir in your keister.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And it's funny, it just all of a sudden, sometimes you can just be so
irritable because you're constipated, and then you put that stuff in, it's like
'ahh', I didn't even have a movement, but I felt like I did."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because it just
goes in there and absorbs all those acids and everything that's having a
problem, that the bacteria will not feed on."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Neutralizes them pretty much.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You know when I detox, it's usually through the knees and the joints."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If I
don't sleep, for instance, at times I'll go through like a lot of pain, and it
goes...and I find that if I don't juice...

Get too acidic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Really, that's what happens."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Acid in the joints and stuff.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Take the pain formula in place of a
smoothie for 2 of your eggs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And also how do you get rid of a long-time wart?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And what is a wart from?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","A wart is usually dead cells that are cartilage, that can no longer function as
cartilage properly, but they're not completely dead, so the body builds it into
the skin and makes it a wart, it's a viral activity, where the virus goes in and
changes the RNA and DNA, so it pulls it out of the joint area and builds it into
the skin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So what's the way to let it go?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What did I use last?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There's several things that I have in the book to get rid
of warts, but they don't work as much as I would like them to, and I just found
something that worked very well, and I can't remember what it is."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I think I need
to eat some meat soon."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Or some brain.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Precisely.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But give me a call and I'll remember and I'll email it to
you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, anything else?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, that's it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, that's it, I'm finished for today."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Phil, too bad."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You know you told me to have an orange and no other fruit, and you told me to
eat ½ grapefruit every other day for ... swelling, should I stop that for now?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And then the thyroid, should I be eating the raw thyroid?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I would say no more than 2 days a week.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh, so that often?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you want to get it well faster, it's up to you if you want energy sooner."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So every other week, twice a week?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because I was usually eating it like 5 days in a row, and then off for like 2
weeks or 3 weeks."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It might be better if you have it more frequently, but less throughout that
week."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, thank you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",All right.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",This is good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Wow, your red blood cells are getting back together."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Should he...Kefir up the...?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",In his brain.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Put into his ears.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Wow, your blood's sure coming
together."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You have metal toxicity all throughout your system.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","How does it show up on the hands, what do you see?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","(TAPE CHANGE)

...about 2 weeks."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Just to stabilize.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No kiwis either?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That would be an okay fruit for you to have.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But not...?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",One a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How long is a day?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",40 hours.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",For you.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",At least 40 hours.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",40 Jewish hours.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You know
what that's like."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Is there such a thing as too much cream?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I like that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, good."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I didn't say for anybody else, I said for him."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because I could drink like 2 pints a day without too much trouble.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you're eating a whole pineapple a day, probably use a quart of cream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That'll reduce, you won't need as much if you're not having all that fruit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","How
much meat are you eating?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",A pound a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Like 3 eggs a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You're only having 3 eggs a day?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Should I have more?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No wonder you're eating all that pineapple!
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Exactly.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, you need about 10-18 a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And what about my juice mixture?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'd continue with the same as you're having.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'm juicing Alfalfa sprouts, is that a bad thing?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It has an enzyme inhibitor in it, if you have too much."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","One day a week is
probably all that you can handle."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And no more than one of those little packages.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And don't mix it up.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Have it only one day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Don't mix it over a 3-day period.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I
can't get over how your digestive system,...I don't know if it's that pineapple,
I've never seen this before... because your digestion is definitely improved."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I only eat one food at a time.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'm very careful about that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's easier to do that, yeah."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I tried having kiwis and milk product or something, and I was thinking, you
know what, I'm going to be really careful."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And no honey either, because honey
was screwing me up too."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, copious amounts, of course, I have a hard time
having any not in excess."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Well that's because you're not having enough fat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You're eating the pineapple.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's going to make anybody crazy.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Whole dietary regime will go nuts.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So the
more eggs, more fat, less fruit, you'll balance out a lot more."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, I cut down on the cheese too, the cheese and honey was difficult to
digest."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, honey can be eaten with cheese, but if you're pigging out on both, just
remember that the honey works on proteins."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And you can't count cheese as a
protein, even though there's protein in it, because when protein has been
dehydrated like in a cheese, the fat and the minerals become the predominant
active ingredient in cheese."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Honey isn't going to help you digest very much of
the cheese, because it digests protein well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So how much meat should I have, should I have more than a pound a day?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, if you increase the eggs, you won't need any more than probably 1-1.5 lbs
of meat a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I've been doing mostly red meat, a little chicken."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Since...

Well, you could use some fish, because you have all this mineral toxicity, it
would help neutralize some of that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I have to go eat the fish in a merchant room parking lot since last time I had
it, any hint of fish my throat swelled shut."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Oh yeah?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I haven't tried it raw yet, though."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Which is the least fishy fish?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Is that a possibility?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Probably tuna.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",To me albacore is very strong.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But
the tuna's less strong to me,...

Maybe trout?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","...but I like the strong fish, I like swordfish, and I like yellowtail, and all
those things are strong."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Cod is actually not too fishy, and also King Mackerel is the least fishy of the
fish I tried, but it's hard to find...

Hard to find it non-farmed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So what should I do to help out my thyroid?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Eat thyroid.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Definitely.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Beef thyroid?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Beef, deer, whatever you can get."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Get a hold of Michael, and when you're up
this way."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",This guy's gonna have a hell of a business.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Listen, I've got
guys in LA that have businesses growing from this."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Like the milk, the guy, he
made arrangements, now he's supplying all of Southern California the Clareville
milk."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So question – the ridges on the nails, any concern over that?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well those ridges mean that you're putting out a lot of the toxic minerals from
solvents that were in the hands, and that will go on for years and years and
years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But there's a nice sheen on them.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So that means they're good and strong.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What about the dry hair?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What about that?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You're very dry.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And if you're eating a pineapple a day, you're burning up all
your fats, you'll be dry forever."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","A pineapple, if you eat a whole
pineapple a day, that will burn up about 3 pints of fat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Really?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's more than I can eat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Just remember this – 80% fats, 5% sugar."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's all it takes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you can take
that big a pineapple and 5 times fat you will need to utilize that properly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You know, now we just got this new …, say it doesn't do honey, it does
vanilla, which has alcohol in it, I'm not crazy, but what do you think?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not a good thing.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","How about vanilla bean in its raw form, that's okay?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's fine.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's better.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not the processed vanilla?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Not in a high amount, if you're putting 1 or 2 drops in, that's okay."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's okay?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",...maybe 3 or 4 drops.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's double of what I just said.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How do my eyes look...?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh my gosh, they're lighter."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Definitely.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Definitely, yeah."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well I guess that
pineapple is doing something good."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Is he tolerable, eating that much?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","...work is horrible, but with me he's fine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Oh.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","...have to be that way...steal everything...

I have a question."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","In France everybody smoked...I was so...can we do something
to clean out all that?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Tars are very difficult to break down.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The only way that I've seen people can
deliberately break down those tars is to eat raw tobacco."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Chew on it and spit
the pulp out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Even chewing it up, and then letting it mold, and then
eating it, also will help dissolve some of those tars."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Where do you get good tobacco, organic tobacco?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",They sell it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",They do?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","American Spirit...

Do you get totally ripped on that?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You can get a little bit of a high because there's nicotine in it, it
stimulates the brain, it's vitamin B niacin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But it won't make you nauseous like chewing tobacco would?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Um...I've never heard of anybody getting nauseous on raw green tobacco.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh, raw green tobacco."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's the better.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh, okay."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So you gotta grow your own.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, you can usually like go into a Jon's store and tell them you want green;
they can get you green."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So what berries would I have, or should I have berries to get rid of the
metals, the toxic metals?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, but I would calm down from the pineapple for a while."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You know, it's
funny, the other person I was talking about that detoxed, eyes went from dark
brown to light green in 3.5 years, she was like that, she would eat 1/4-1/2
pineapple a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","She was a basket case, but definitely cleaned quicker than
anybody else."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So if you can tolerate him...

He's okay with me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You just take it all out on your employees, right?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Poor guys.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Customers too.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I mean I'm...the opposite...babes...I couldn't believe it, I've never seen him
like that before...

That's what too much fruit will do for you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I think it's usually better to do
it more gradually than that, but...

I'm not that way."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, become that way."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Eat more eggs, and more meat, and calm down."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So how can you blend the eggs without oxidizing, can you just like take a fork,
and slowly...?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, if you want to blend them in something, then add a little bit of cream or
milk or something that will coat the egg white so it doesn't oxidize."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Is it better to have the whites and the yolks separately in separate meals...?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's better to have them together, except for one person I suggested to, to
have them separate."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And what if our stools are green, is that mean there's poor digestion, or...?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That means that you're not breaking down all of the chlorophyll in the green
juice, but that's okay."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If I take my smoothie and put the eggs in there in the middle of the milk, and
whatever else I put in there, that's okay, the eggs won't oxidize?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Correct.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because it'll be coated.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What about putting like a piece of pineapple or strawberries, in the smoothie?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Then you're going to make solvents that will be for detoxification.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you want
to detoxify more, that's fine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But if you do that often, get ready for a flu or
a cold."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That's why in the book I have the smoothies with fruit as a remedy for
it, because it helps more solvents get in there and break everything down, so
it'll flow out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I have sneeze attacks every time I take that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",… causing you to dry out then.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You need some cream with it or something if
you're going to do that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I put coconut cream in.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, but that's more of a solvent."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you need to soothe your tissues, you
need cow's cream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","One more clarification – eating the thyroid twice a week, for one thing, can
I eat it two days in a row, is that okay?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's hard to get,...

Definitely two days in a row is fine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And how much at a time?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because I have a hard time...if I can get one of those,
about like that, I feel lucky."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, like I say, if the new recipe that I gave, if you put 1tsp of salsa in
with that, it is so delicious in comparison."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's the texture which just is so disgusting to me.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, did you ever have potato soup, or clam chowder?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's what it's like.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And with the new salsa recipe, it all of a sudden is like a soup."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Okay, I'll try that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I've been doing the new thing that you told me...the
chunks and swallow it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Oh – wash it down?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The coward's way.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You should see me in there, ugh...

No, that's very brave, anybody who's eating the glands, that's brave."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Is olive oil okay with beef?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I have another question.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'm trying to figure out why I have so much metal
toxicity."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I grew up in...my parents had a bar and a nightclub, it was always
like a cloud of smoke, and I breathed that for many years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Could it be from
that?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Definitely.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Absolutely.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So I need to chew tobacco?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It would be helpful.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What about the homeopathic remedy for that?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, because when they use the alcohol, it destroys the bacteria that will
help break it down."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I can't handle alcohol actually.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What about the little pellet?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, once it's dehydrated, it doesn't do it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You need it in its raw form so that
you can get the bacteria and all the enzymes to form bacterias and molds to
break it down in your system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How often would you recommend chewing tobacco?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, if you have too much, you can put yourself in pneumonia."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Cleaning too
fast."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Or into meningitis, when it cleans out of the brain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I recommend
probably eating it, chewing and spitting out the pulp, about 1tbsp worth, or
about 2” by 2” piece of the leaf, no more than 4 days a week."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What's it mean when I have like a wheezing sound in my lungs?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Means you have no fat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You're too dry.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Also could mean that the mucous isn't
forming properly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",More eggs?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Definitely.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","How many eggs about should I be having, per day or week, do you have any idea?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I didn't tell you?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Let me see your hands again.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",8-12 a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'd say 10-12 is
probably better."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You're welcome.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You didn't say eggs for me either.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Let me see your hands again.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",6-12.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Can I freeze raw butter?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So freezing anything really is out of the question?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, not out of the question, you just destroy some of the enzymes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It flattens it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because the goat butter doesn't last very long, I mean, I can make it
almost...it's so labor-intensive, I could just make a bunch of it and then
freeze it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, I'll show you how to do it easier and quicker."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I'd love to see that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How long does raw butter last?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","...still have some Steuve's..

If you do it the right...if you have the Steuve's - I've had last up to 12
months in the refrigerator."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How could you?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Where does he...what's his address?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I better go home, that direction, and
become a burglar!"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It lasts over...probably a year is the longest I've kept it, it may last longer
than that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I have a couple of questions.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","One, I've heard pineapple discussed a lot, for
some people it seems to be like burning fat, others, her recommendation about
it, relieving fat congestion, I know you didn't mention it in my case, you
mentioned kiwi rather than pineapple, should I avoid the pineapple for me?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, because it will cause too much fat depletion in your system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The second thing is, because of the arrhythmia, I've been on a half-aspirin
regimen for quite a while."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Is that contributing to the stomach issue and should
I see if I can...

That creates like a cement, it goes into a cement in your lymph system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So, the question is, given that there's a risk for me if I don't take it, in
terms of having a clot …, in what way can I address that until I can somehow
manage to get rid of the arrhythmia?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I wouldn't worry about the arrhythmia.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I had arrhythmia for...from the age of
probably 13, up until I was in my mid-thirties."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What kind?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I don't remember what it was right now, what it was diagnosed as, I was so
young, but it was serious."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I had angina along with it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You know how serious
angina is, basically like a heart attack every time you have it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","My father, he
came down with an arrhythmia."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You know what I said?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I said 'Don't count!
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Don't
count!'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Simple as that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And he hasn't done a thing about it, and he's fine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Most
people don't need to do anything about it, it's again a way to sell a drug."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, I avoided any other medications, but this is one thing that I over and
over again, was told was a risk, with atrial …, that you get a swelling of the
blood flow through the atrium, and they say under some conditions, that can
coagulate and it can...

It's so rare, and if you're on this diet at all, it's not...

...it shouldnt matter?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I've been doing...I have a completely plant-based
magnesium supplement I'm taking, it doesn't have any kind of magnesium salts in
it, it's only using plant materials to get the magnesium."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Doesn't make any difference.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Once it's dehydrated and once it's isolated...

It's in liquid form, it's a … forget it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I have a calcium supplement, forget
it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Waste it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because what you get in that supplement, you will get and utilize every bit, in
about ½ cup of milk."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",In a whole bottle of that supplement.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So rely on the milk and the juice to give me the minerals that I need?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Correct.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And the cheese.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And CoQ10?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Eliminate that as well?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Eliminate that entirely, that's very toxic to a lot of people that have
arrhythmia problems."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Oh.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And hawthorn leaf berry, eliminate that as well?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you have the actual berry, fine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, this is a powder."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, no."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",He's got a hawthorn berry tree.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",We have a hawthorn.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It hasn't...flower...

So, you know, one of those a week is enough."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How about algae?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I did a lot of experiment with that, and I didn't find that it did much of
anything in a person who's on a totally raw diet."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I found that with people who
were not on a good diet, it provided some minerals that were important to them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Also, because it was so high in sodium, it created lowering of bacteria, which I
don't like."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So probably the most remedial effect was that it was more of a
balanced sodium that most people got, and it made them feel better because it
stopped detoxification."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I tried it after going on a raw diet for a month, just one time, and it just
destroyed my digestion, and I threw the stuff on the plants when I got home."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Exactly.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",They'll love it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Make a little compost with it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, and boy, the
plants love it because it's perfect for them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So what about...like Howell sells us enzymes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Plant-based enzymes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You know, everybody is trying to market something to make all of their time and
research worthwhile, and he tried to do it, and he has this theory, and
postulation that will work."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","However in actual practice, it doesn't work."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","For a
few people in certain circumstances it may work, but it's not controllable."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You
don't know for whom it's going to work, and for whom it's not."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I was reading about two different studies, a soccer team in Australia, a
football team in Oregon, that took supplemental enzymes, and they documented
that their injury healing time was shorter when they had...

But those guys eat 99.9% cooked everything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So even those that are processed
are better than what they're already getting."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's like people who use essential
oils that are heated at 357 degrees, will not have as good a reaction as people
who are using 257 degrees distilled."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So there is an improvement, but on a raw
diet, anything that isn't raw is not going to be an improvement."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Just like the supplements...?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It works well for somebody that has a similar processed diet that goes along
with the processed item...?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Correct.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That makes sense.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So honey would aid digestion of protein, is there anything that aids digestion
of fat?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You mean a particular food?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Food, or something like that, like honey...

Any of the fruits."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Any of the proteins.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It doesn't take much fruit; it takes
more protein.- 15% protein, 5% fruit - to utilize fats properly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I see.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The diet you recommend.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I crave fat a lot.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You crave fat a lot.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So if I don't eat any honey, is that okay?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Why, because you can't control yourself?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Precisely.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh, I can talk about that, I went through a period where I binged on honey, and
I just let myself do it, and eventually it leveled out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, it will level out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Just have a little bit at a time.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But if you'll make yourself have meals at a particular...2 eggs, and some milk,
and some honey, if you do that, you won't binge on anything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's when you let
yourself get too hungry, and then you start binging, you're going to binge on
whatever you're eating at the time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So milk – even though the lactose in the milk is okay with the carbohydrate
and the protein together, the lactose carbohydrate in the milk is okay with the
protein eggs, it digests just fine?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You're talking about the lactate is...the lactose is a sugar.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Right, and that digests okay, because whenever I have eggs with the honey, I
get nauseous, kind of dizzy,...

It may be causing a liver detoxification, or even a gall bladder
detoxification."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So then I would cut out the honey.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I get that too.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I had that problem every time that I had it, because I had that poison
mushroom."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And after that, any time I ate honey with eggs, I got cramps, I got
nauseous, everything, so I couldn't eat it for...let's see, I ate that in 1981,
and it was just last year, was the first time I could combine honey and eggs
together."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Last year.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So it took a lot of years.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So was it good to do the detoxification, or was it good until you could do it?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well because it was so painful, it knocked me out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I had to do it gradually.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","18
years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I've had enough pain, I'm no glutton for punishment."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I want to get well
quickly, but not that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I don't want to do it that way.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Do you have any objective number measurements about how the ingestion of the
large quantity of raw fat affects things like cholesterol, homocysteine levels,
and does it even matter?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It doesn't matter at all.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because your body...I've got lots of blood analysis
for it, I'll give you some of the extreme examples."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","A banker who had a 267
cholesterol level - I put him on a stick of raw butter a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He was about
6'3”."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So he's a big man.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And very overweight.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I had him on a stick of
butter a day, about 4oz of cream a day, and about 10 eggs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Raw eggs.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So you know
the cholesterol involved in that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","His cholesterol...and he had the test done 3
weeks later, his cholesterol was down to 167."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Okay.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I have an olympic gymnast, 26 years old now, when she came to me, she had a 327
cholesterol level."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And if she didn't keep that up to about that level, she could
not work out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But the problem was, she kept having colds and flus every 2-3
weeks, and it knocked her out, she couldn't even work out for a week sometimes,
10 days, and she'd have to start her workout all over again."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So they were going
to drop her from the team."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because there's no way that they could keep up with
that, no telling, the games came along, which cycle she would be on."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So she went
onto a raw diet, her level stayed at 327."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But because they were good
cholesterols, she didn't have a cold, and she could go right through and not
have a problem with the cholesterol."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I've got a champion skater, figure skater - she had a high cholesterol level,
right around 210, which is not real high, but it's still high for a female,
she's about 5'3”-5'4” I guess, somebody who works out, skating, 6-8 hours a
day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I gave her twice the amount of cholesterol that she was eating previous to
that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Her cholesterol level went down to 187.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And, she goes out there and works,
and these other girls going out there 'huff...puff...', can't go on, she's going
5-6 hours, and she just keeps going and going and going."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So, I can't say that
the cholesterol level makes any difference, it's whether it's raw or cooked."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So is it when we're younger, you can pretty much get away with anything, your
body just doesn't notice it, gets away with it?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You have growth hormones, you have youth hormones, you have lots of adrenaline,
if you're healthy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you're a child like me, I didn't get away with anything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I
was born sickly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So, some kids, a lot of kids, get away with everything until
their growth hormones fall off."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And then it's all downhill.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So what would be good to rebuild my tendons and things?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I still have some pain
left in my right hip."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Rebuild your tendons, is that what you said?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If you could take tendons, and chop them up and grind them, in a meat grinder,
you would probably, if you can digest it, break it down, and the best possible
way is to grind it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Put it through the grinder about 3 times.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","To get it down
into the smallest fragments."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So when the HCL invades it, it will dissolve more
of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But it's a very hard substance to digest in a human system.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","With our lack
of help."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But that's the quickest way, the next best way is to eat a lot of
chicken."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Thanks.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Can we do anything to help the Steuves...?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, Steuve's now is at the mercy of the people who will process their
substances, and what they want."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So this company that they contracted to do it
got threatened by the state to be closed down."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That scared them for about 6
months, and then when that got all squared away, and everything was settled out
with the health department, that no, that would be conspiracy, and that would be
prejudicial."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I'm glad that they did that, even though it canceled us being able
to have the butter right away."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It set a precedent that if they did go and do
that and harass this company, then they would be facing a tremendous lawsuit,
and definitely would lose it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I'm glad that the one health official, one
inspector that came to that, said 'you do Steuve's, and we're gonna really come
in and do this to you, and do that to you, and do this to you, and do that to
you.'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It was bad because they backed out from Steuve's saying 'we won't do it',
but now that it's cleared up, there's a threat to the health department, if they
do anything out of the ordinary, they're in big trouble."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So this company said
that they're going to start manufacturing it this month, and it'll be out the
22nd."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",But we will see.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now they have up in Oakdale, everybody, that's near
Modesto, that's where one of the Steuve's farms is."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They have just increased
their herd to 350, they're going to start producing raw milk, raw kefir, and raw
butter."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They do not have all the facilities together up there in Oakdale to do
that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So it may take some time for them to manufacture it, so they don't have to
ever rely upon anybody else again, and plus they will not be in Los Angeles
county."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Milk commission.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Right.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No medical milk commission.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Medical milk commission has … since
Stuve's stopped producing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There's no...

Yeah."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",He's also growing organic beef now too.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He's doing all this, his milk will be organic when it comes out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","How...take to them to put together organic farm, they have to have good cows...

They're already organic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","This particular farm established their organic a year
ago."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They just sell all their milk to Strauss, who's one of those organic
producers."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Their contract is only for so many gallons.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And I think about 100
cows takes care of that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Now they have 350.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So they're selling their milk to
these organic pasteurizers, but they're not contracting that says 'we will agree
that we will give you this much every week, or every month', or whatever it is."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",They can just stop...?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",They can stop at any moment and produce their own.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Why is Clareville not organic?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because he doesn't buy the organic feed.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's a little bit more expensive.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",He might have to change.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The competition.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",He might not be the only game in town.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yup.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What do the growth hormones look like on the fingers?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh, it's an aura thing that I see, that is not...when I taught nutrition, only
about 3 people out of 15 could see what I saw, of that particular thing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","There's
a lot of other things that nobody could see, and that's when I realized that it
was a particular faculty I had, to see all those things, what some people could
see some, and most could not see."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",70% of what I see.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So it's an intuitional...

You see it in...eye...?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh I can see it in the hand, but other people don't see it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What I see.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So it's a gift you have?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do you channel at all?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No, because there are too many people who can't get it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I try to pull down
the information to a perfectly physiological bare minimum perceptions, and when
I finish a book that will help do that and give people some measurement to go
on, like the mounds that everybody can see, the coloring and why it's not
working."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They can just see that, okay, the thyroid gland is okay, but not all of
them will be able to tell whether it's functioning properly or not, unless they
can see the coloring and identify the coloring."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So, I will have everything that
I can see in the book, but whether a person has the faculties to be able to
discern that from their perceptions, depends upon the individual."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But I will
start teaching once that pedagogue is complete, because then somebody will be
able to go away from the class and say 'oh yes, this is what he said about this,
this is what he said about that.'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because people left my class after a week, 8
hours a day, for 5 days a week."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They went back and said 'that was a lot of
information, it's on tape recorder', but without the irises, without something
to see to remind them of what they were looking at at the time, they didn't
remember."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because what we did, is I'd take people out to Venice Beach, I would
pay these homeless to let us look in their eyes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","In kind of code-talk, point out
to the different toxins and different conditions in the iris."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So in this case the liver's shot?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Exactly.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Could you imagine what the poor guy would be like?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He had enough to worry about before you came...

Right."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What would you typically see when...would you see all varies of illness?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh, various."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Incredible, how varied it was with each person."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Did you see somebody where you say 'hey, you need to go do this now, to keep
from dying'?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I wouldn't say that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Really?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",To somebody that didn't come to me.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","If I were reading somebody's eyes, and they
didn't come to me, and I was using them as a subject, I would never say anything
like that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Unless they asked.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",One guy did ask.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What did he ask?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What did you have to tell him?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He was in really good...he looked good physically, but he did his drinking, and
he was a homeless person, pretty young, like in his late 20s, and thought he was
infallible."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Obviously he had some good growth hormones that continued with him.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","However he had severe caking in his eye, which means that he's binding - the
AGEs were binding - with the adrenaline, and caking like plaque throughout his
tissues."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So the easiest way out is a heart attack, the hardest way out is
multiple sclerosis."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So he asked me, what his condition was, so I explained that
to him."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He says 'you gave me some real bad bad news, didn't you?'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I said 'you
asked, I never would tell you...I would've never told you that without giving
you answers.'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","He says 'okay, what's the answer?'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Get ready...

Ha ha."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I said 'stay off alcohol, eat lots of raw meat, and lots of raw fats.'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",'You're out of your mind.'
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I said 'yup, I am.'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And he stormed away.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So I
debate sometimes whether I tell somebody."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Now what most of the time I'll say is
'you don't want to know."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You don't want to know.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",You don't want to hear it.'
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That usually dissolves it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","What's the argument when you tell us we're on the diet, and you go 'hey, people
used to eat this way 1000 years ago', and they go 'yeah, they lived to be 30
years old too.'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's a fallacy.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Complete fallacy.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That one is used over and over and over.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Yeah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Such a fallacy.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I read it was because they died at childbirth, that made the average lower, and
if you got a broken arm, you'd die of it, and that sort of thing...

Not even that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",People didn't die of broken arms.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Was it Napoleon...died of broken arms?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Napoleon?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","No...

Ha ha."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Who was it?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Christopher Columbus?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Maybe they had...deficiency...sailors.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Right, they didn't eat very well on the sailboat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do you know of any cultures that lived on a diet similar to this one?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And it was mainly raw until the Germans brought cauldrons for them to cook in.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Because they had no way of cooking.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",In that kind of climate.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They had no metal
containers."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",There were no cauldrons that existed.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Not much wood?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",No.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","So everything was raw, basically."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And they had no dental caries until 1886,
and that was in one of the Eskimos that lived in one of the colonies, the white
colonies, and had been eating sugar and breads for 50 years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","That was the first
case of cavity."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And the first case of cancer wasn't until 1934.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",And what was their average lifespan?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It was about what ours was.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But you have to understand that if we took our
white people and put them in Alaska, most of them would die within about 1-3
years in that kind of a climate."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The Eskimo lived the exact age as we are, and
to 110, in that extreme temperature."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And also, no sunlight...

Yeah."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And the Masai eat nothing but raw milk, raw blood, they mix it together
and drink it, and raw meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And they have no disease, they're considered the
healthiest, strongest, tallest, most agile race in the world."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","They're so smart,
that they won't even let the white man get within 20 miles of their villages."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Every day they will march 20 miles, to entertain the white people and do rituals
for them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","But then the government protects...they will not...no white man is
allowed within 20 miles of their villages."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",That's smart.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Because they saw what
it was doing to them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","The white man was bringing candy, potato chips, and
garbage, and they were getting ill."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Having digestive problems.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","And for us,
that's no big deal, but for them, with no illnesses and no diseases ever, never
a case of diarrhea or anything like that, and all of a sudden you start having
this, and you want to stop it right away if you're smart."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What color are their eyes?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Amber.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",A beautiful yellow.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",What is your take on royal jelly?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",The product of the beehive?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Wonderful.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's what the bees eat for the first 3 days of their life.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","It's only
what the queen eats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",It's only that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","From what I understand, it stimulates the pituitary gland to produce growth
hormones."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, actually it has some actual growth hormone stimulants within it, not just
to the pituitary."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Yeah, so if you take like a BB sized amount of it and eat it
every time you eat meat, you're going to increase the regenerative effects of
your meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",How do you keep growth hormones alive in your body?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, I think that you would your entire life if you didn't leech from eating
cooked foods."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Oh, so if you kept on a nice raw diet, you'd be abundant with growth homone."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Right.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","For your entire life, probably."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","You know, there are the fables of those
people who did live on raw foods and they lived 1000 years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I don't know if
that's possible, but we should be living to at least 147 because all other
creatures live 7 times the time it takes them to finish maturation."

that's 21."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So we should be living to 147.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",We're not even living half that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Most
of the people out there."

intuitive...

Yes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",So it's a gift some people have.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","I think that everybody could develop it if they wanted to, because I certainly
didn't have that faculty."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Do you feel like you can diagnose intuitively?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Well, I don't diagnose, I'm not a doctor."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",I analyze.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",Ha ha ha.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt","Do you feel like this diet has something to do with helping to develop those
abilities?"

Yeah."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_May_6,_2000.txt",There was...everybody I've known has developed psychically that way.

A: Ok, start behind me."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Roger – do you have a question?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Yeah – what about green tea?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Do you think it’s beneficial?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: A lot of people put it out as a health food because they’re selling a
product."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Green tea is your vegetable juice.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Cooked green tea has lots of toxic minerals in it – any metal that’s in the
vegetable when you cook it you release that as a toxin; it’s no longer bound
to the esters in the plant."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, anytime you cook anything – whether it’s tea
– no matter what it is – it becomes toxic."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Now there is some tea that comes from Korea as a green (Inaudible).
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You put
it in cold water."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Would that be any different?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, they’ve had to steam it and cook it to get (Inaudible) out of the
warmth."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Ok.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: And it takes great heat to do that – the processing.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: If you leave the tea bag in the water and leave it in the sun, you’re
going to get metals."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, it’s a vegetable format – it’s vegetable juice."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You’re not
going to get much from it because there’s no enzyme activity in it; there’s
no active enzymes in it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Is it better than a glass of water?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, it’s probably a little bit better than just water – but pretty
close to just water."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: What if you put it in a blender – like one time I put some mint leaves,
blended it and then strained out –

A: Fresh mint leaves?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Fresh mint leaves.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: That’s fine.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Yeah?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: That’s fine.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Is it too much water though?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: It’s still too much water.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Yeah – ok.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Better to have juice – add mint to your juice.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",It would be a lot better.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Ok.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Do you have a question?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: I do: I was wondering what do you do if you’re travelling.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I’m going to
–

A: I travel all the time."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: But how do you do – do you take things?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah – I have a letter from an MD that says I was diagnosed with diabetes
and cancer and I have to eat every hour and I have to take so much food."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","When I
go to Asia the letter says I have to take 20 to 30 pounds with me and you
can’t x-ray it – you have to check each one by hand."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I go two hours
early to give them time to do all that process."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But I write letters for my
patients and I charge 80 to 100, depending upon the situation and then that
lasts about four months."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",You can use the letter for four months.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And some people
can use it for a couple years or if you get a TSA agent who’s a tough guy –
he’s not going to let you use it for more than four months."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, it says: I need two quarts of milk, I need my raw meat, sauce, vegetable
juice."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I go on with a whole bag of foods and have it hand-checked."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Because
it says: Cannot be scanned – it has to be hand-checked."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Is that base carry on?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: And they do it?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Don’t put anything in check-in – they put everything through a huge
radiation scanner which is 100 times an x-ray."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Do you have any liquids with you?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah – I said I take two quarts of milk and a vegetable juice.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","When I’m
going to Asia I’ll take three quarts of milk, plus a juice – a quart."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I
take a gallon (Inaudible)."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Do you ever bring your juice on the plane?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",How long is your flight?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, let’s say I take off here – I’ve been to Taipei – I’m two
hours there – lay-over – and by the time I get to Bangkok it’s about 24
hours."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: The whole time your juice is there.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: I don’t mind fermented juice.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: You don’t mind the fermented juice?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, fermented juice is a good detox."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","When I went away I left a quart of
juice in the refrigerator."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I came back two a half months later – I drank the
whole thing."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, my lord."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: It’s delicious.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Fermented juice is delicious.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Did it taste like beer?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, it tastes very tangy though."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What containers do you put them in to?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Glass – all my food’s in glass.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Except this last time I got (Inaudible).
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Ever have a problem when they check it with a scanner once it goes through?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: They check it with the metal detector – they don’t put it through the
scanner."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Because when I do it they wipe it with a white circle, put it under a
machine to check for –

A: To check for nitrogen – yeah."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: They said they can’t see it (inaudible).
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","They threw away all my butter –
Sacramento Airport."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: And we had a letter from you too.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, you may need to wipe before you take it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Must have got some manure in it.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Because the manure has nitrogen that’s
what it’s like in the city if it’s near a farm directly."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I was always wipe
my honey."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Honey has strong nitrogen in it, so it sets off – like it’s
nitrous oxide."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Do you take a glass of honey?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Just a wet cloth – a damp cloth – the outside.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Do you take a glass of honey?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah – I take a jar of honey.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I take butter on and everything.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: And eggs?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, I even take eggs – not all the time I take eggs – I’ve had too
many accidents with eggs, but most of the time I do take them."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Can you put them in a jar?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Pardon?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Can you put them raw into a jar?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: I don’t really want to do that.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",You could.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Is it going to oxidize, or?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah – I don’t like them oxidizing, but sometimes I’ll make a
milkshake – eat my eggs that way."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, two quarts of milk, a quart of
milkshake, a quart of juice, or a pint of juice."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Uh-huh.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: So, that’s how I do it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: What would be your recommendations be for treating skin disorders: eczema /
psoriasis?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, like I said in the book – the moisturizing and lubrication formula
– have at least two a day."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If you have say psoriasis which is pretty severe
– have two of those a day and take three ounces at a time – a good three
ounces about every two to three hours."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Keep doing that and take it down to size
and then take it down to just one."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It would take about eight months to get rid
of psoriasis."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If it’s eczema, could be longer."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",It’s pretty rare.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Especially
when it’s easily digestible with the honey and the lemon juice."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Do you have a question?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Yes, regarding the raw cheese regimen that you recommended for me and
others: nuts and bolts – how much leeway?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","For instance – do you always eat
the cheese before a drink or a meal?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Do you always eat it a half hour regardless
of when you eat that sugar-cube that you’ve mentioned?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, I recommend that people eat small amounts of cheese to absorb the
poisons that are constantly dumping into the stomach and intestines."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","That’s
not the normal route; that’s not the healthy route for toxins to leave the
body – 90% of toxins are supposed to leave through the skin."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Because the lymph
systems are so blocked – the connective tissue is so jammed with trans-fatty
acids which are plastic fats that you’ve all been raised on – donuts, chips,
French fries – anything that’s been fried and heavy with carbohydrates then
fried in a trans-fatty oil."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Trans-fatty oil means the oils that’s been
hydrogenated and hydrogenation is a process of making into plastic."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So,
trans-fatty acids are plastic fats – plastic oils."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","99% of all oils used to fry
foods – no matter what they are – are trans-fatty acids because they have an
indefinite shelf life – 100 years – they’re dead."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","That’s why they are
plastic – they are not alive anymore."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","They will not help you – they will jam
your lymphatic system – jam everything in your body, so –

G: Aajonus, I have relatives who are going to fry because they don’t believe
this."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","What is the best thing to tell them if they’re going to fry some of
these – to fry it in lard?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, no, you should fry it in stone-pressed olive oil or coconut cream or
coconut oil."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Coconut oil?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Or olive oil.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Olive oil.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Right – coconut.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Back to my question: Yes –

A: Everybody has (Inaudible)."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Right.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: So, eating this cheese will absorb those poisons as the body dumps them into
the stomach rather than out the skin and it does that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","The lymph system takes
its waste and dumps it under the skin to be perspired out of the skin."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If it’s
jammed it won’t do it, so it dumps it into the mucous membranes and if you get
a cold or a flu or you’re spitting up mucous regularly – that’s
elimination through your mucous membranes."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","The mucous membranes of the
intestinal tract also – that’s where most of them get dumped."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Whenever you
get nauseous that’s an indication that something’s toxic you’ve just
eaten, or somewhere else stored in your body is going to the stomach and dumping
into the stomach."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Now hydrochloric acid neutralizes about 80% of all toxins, so nausea creates a
lot of hydrochloric acid."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","The stomach produces massive amounts of hydrochloric
acid from nausea."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",That is our reaction.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It forces the stomach to produce
tremendous amounts of hydrochloric acid – more like five to eight times more
than what’s normal to produce the protein from meat - so it’s very
concentrated."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If you vomit, that means your body’s decided to use that
hydrochloric acid to utilize it to expend, and then you get rid of it
immediately – vomiting is the quickest way to get rid of the most poisons."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Next is diarrhea, but then you upset the whole ecological bacterial environment
of the intestines."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, the cheese will absorb it, depending upon the toxicity of the person."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I
recommend people eat a little sugar-cubed size amount of cheese with just half a
tsp."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","every 15 to 60 minutes, depending upon the individual."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Can you eat clay?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Clay won’t do it – if you have clay you’re going to get constipated
and also not digest everything."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Clay is helpful in that situation, but you
can’t eat it pretty well."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: How often?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Once a day – twice a day at most for clay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Could you add butter with the cheese?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Butter to the cheese is ok.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",You should do it since you’re so thin.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So,
that will absorb the toxins."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Now, your question?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Yes, as far as leeway in taking it every 15/45 minutes: Do you always take
it 10 minutes before a meal, or could you just stick to the interval throughout
the day regardless of the meal?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: If you’re going to have a meal – let’s say it was at a certain time
and your cheese is supposed to fall in the midst of it – always eat cheese 10
minutes before that meal or drink your milkshake, whatever it is."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, you’ll
absorb the poisons into the cheese and they won’t get into your food because
if it gets into your food you’re just going to recycle your poisons – and
that’s what 99% of people do: Recycle their poisons."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What do you when you’re sipping milk every 10/15 minutes?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Let’s say you
take a little sip and –

A: Still stick to your cheese every 15, 20, 30, 45, 60 minutes – still do
that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Do you mean do the cheese and wait 10 minutes for the milk?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah – uh-huh.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Ok.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And let’s say I’ve got construction workers who are heavily toxic
and laboratory personal who deal with a lot of formaldehyde and mercury – I
have them eat a cube every 15 minutes."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, they’ll take that and wait seven
minutes, drink some sport formula or milk, or milkshake and then seven minutes
have that piece of cheese again – and they do that all day long."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","When it comes
to a meal of course they don’t eat that cheese during that half of the meal,
but they eat it 10 minutes before the meal and then about 25 minutes after the
meal they have cheese again, then 10 minutes after that is when you have honey
and cheese together."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","When you have cheese without honey without fruit you do not
digest the cheese; there are no enzymes in dehydrated food, no matter what it
is."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, you have to have honey or some kind of fruit – like an acidic fruit
– like pineapple or papaya – to provide the enzymes to digest that cheese."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, twice a day I recommend that 25 minutes after your meal you have a little
piece of cheese, 10 minutes after that you have your cheese with honey and
that’s your mineral supplement."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Ok?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I’ve seen women with 32% bone loss and osteoporosis reverse that in nine
months by doing that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Nine months.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Wow.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: It used to take two – two and a half – three years before I started
experimenting with that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Now nine months.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Any kind of raw cheese or even a cottage cheese?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Does not matter.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Cottage cheese ok?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Cottage is fine – as long as it’s not too wet.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Not too wet.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Does it have to be unsalted?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Has to be unsalted.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Salt is an explosive – it starts fractionating your
food, so if you have raw salted cheese you’re going to reabsorb your poisons."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",If you have pasteurized cheese you’re going to reabsorb your poisons.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If you
have salted pasteurized cheese you’re going to really not synthesize, as well
as reabsorbing your poisons – toxins."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Do you have a question?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Not yet.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Ok.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Come back.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What’s the best way to help re-mineralize your teeth?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Just the way I said it: Eat cheese often, so your body’s not using your
key minerals to bind with the poisons."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","When you’re eating the cheese and honey
together, you’re filling your body with tremendous amounts of … If you’ve
got a real serious problem at any particular time, you do that three times a
day: twice after a meat meal because you’re only having one meat meal a day
– that means you have to take it two other times – and the middle of the
night is the one time in the middle of the night that is best."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And that’ll
help if you stick with it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: And is it true that you detox your head through your mouth through your
teeth?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yes – your brain detoxes through the sinuses, but mainly the gums, the
tongue and the salivary glands."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If you’ve got a white tongue that indicates
the poisons are mainly leaving the tongue – your body uses the calcium,
phosphorous, magnesium and potassium to bind with those poisons, or else your
tongue would turn into a very acidic, sore, bleeding appendage."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, that white
tongue – although the Chinese say that’s a bad thing – it’s a good
thing."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Your body is still using those minerals to attach to the toxins coming
through the mouth."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Scrape it off, that’s fine – take some oil or something
and just swish it around in your mouth to clean it off the tongue – it’s all
good."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And you can swallow it after it passes the main (Inaudible).
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: As far as re-mineralizing teeth is the cheese a substitute for the fermented
milk and egg shell formula that you recommended to me last year?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, it works a little better."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: The cheese is better?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Good, I like it better."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: I do to.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Do you eat the cheese and honey 10 minutes before a cheese?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: You eat the cheese – it’s always the cheese 10 minutes before you have
the cheese and honey."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Yeah, but even in the middle of the night do you do it?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, still I have a piece of cheese first but you don’t have to wait a
full 10 minutes – 5 minutes is fine during the middle of the night."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And when
you have that cheese with honey it should be about a three to one ratio –
maximum."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, let’s say you’re having a tbsp."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","of cheese, you have a tsp."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","of
honey only; you have three tbsp."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","of cheese, you can have two a half to three
tsp."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",of honey.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Ok, Kathy’s waving."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: What do I do – there’s people that say to me my hearing is going out and
I am confused because I’ve been on the diet since eighteen years in December,
believe it or not, when I came to you and started – and I don’t know what to
do."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, you’re still going to degenerate because you spent 45 years on a
toxic diet, so every cell is inundated with toxins."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It takes 40 years –
according to Pottenger and Howell’s work – to remove all the toxins from the
body when you’re on a 100% raw diet."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If you’re not on a 100% raw diet,
it’s going to take longer – so there’s going to be deterioration somewhere
until it’s gone."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Well, it takes the hot baths – are going to pull out some of it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Hot baths help discharge a lot of the poisons throughout the skin – yes.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Do them at the ears too.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Do them to the ears – but you usually don’t put your head under the
water so you put a hot water bottle at one ear one night and the next ear at the
other night."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah – and that’s the best way.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Whenever you have a problem area the way
to speed increase circulation and nutrients to that area is applying heat."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If
you apply ice or cold, what happens?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It shrinks and constricts – reduces –
shrinks the amount of flow of nutrients to that area."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Take your athletes for
example: They get injured they pack ice on it – what happens?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Bruising
normally means that you’re swelling and the swelling is increasing those
nutrients to the area."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",You cut that off and what happens?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","These athletes are
constantly getting surgeries because they’re starting over – because
they’re not cleaning out the dead cells; they’re just forcing themselves to
create scar tissue – it means putting bricks in the wall – dead cells to
heal an area."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Because you heal can you do hot, cold, cold, hot, going to cold, hot, cold?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: You can do cold for two minutes, but you don’t want to jump in ice –
unless you’re a polar bear."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Ok – do you have a question?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What are your thoughts about Alzheimer’s and Dementia?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, Alzheimers – a lot of it comes from mercury."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Also, it’s been
related to aluminum poisoning – both of those."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I’m not sure that aluminum on
its own will cause that because, according to Calgary University’s research,
the lesions of it created in neurons were only created with mercury and not when
they applied aluminum, and barium and other minerals."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I think that it is
connected with aluminum because a lot of people are discharging aluminum –
I’ve had a lot of high aluminum levels from vaccines – and that includes
mercury and aluminum."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I think they’re associating aluminum to dementia too
often."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: (Inaudible).
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, but I haven’t seen it confirmed by anybody – Calgary is the only
one that I knew who has done definitive research on that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If you look at the
lesions, the fractionation of the neurons only occurred in the company of
mercury and not in the minerals."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, aluminum does not create a neurological
condition of degeneration."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Now, it can interfere with synapse transmission, but
it doesn’t cause neuronal decay – like mercury does."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, it’s mostly from
mercury poisoning and you have had a lot of that – and it takes a lot to get
that out."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Now since I was subdued in that hotel room and injected with those three shots
my mercury levels – my aluminum levels are off the charts."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Same with vaccines
– I’ve had two vaccines."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, that’s obvious to me what they have injected
me with."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Now, my hair’s gone very grey and I’ve lost six teeth now since I
was injected."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And I have berries with eggs and vinegar and pineapple almost
every day to get rid of those poisons faster and lots of cheese to help remove
that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And after those injections my skin was bursting open and bruising and
bleeding."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It happened over when I headed back – and it looks like I was hit
with a grenade – the shrapnel from a bomb."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Eggs, berries and what else?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Pineapple, vinegar and berries – all of those chelate with those metal
toxins."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Does it get out the vaccines?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: And heavy metals.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Everybody does it different amounts.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well it depends: If you have a higher level aluminum you have more
raspberries and strawberries; if you have more mercury, lead and other dark
metals, then the dark berries are preferable."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Now, blueberries are very good and
they take it out smoothly."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If you have blackberries you’re going to have a
heavier detox – even have some dementia as you detox some of that mercury and
blackberries."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Those bigger berries, you’re talking about?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Blackberries.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What about raspberries?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Like I said – raspberries are good for getting aluminum and iron.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, what’s the proportion of the vinegar and things like that?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, it depends upon what you can take."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It depends – when I’m making it
I’ll make three cups to four cups a day and I’ll drink it throughout the day
instead of the milkshakes."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I still have my other foods but I don’t drink that
within let’s say 45 minutes of a meat meal."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And that is my fruit meal; I just
spread the fruit meal throughout the day instead of having it one time of the
day."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And I will have about four to five eggs in it, depending upon the size of
the eggs – medium eggs will be four; small ones I’ll have five eggs; I’ll
have about a half a cup of cream; I’ll have about one and a quarter cup of
berries; I use a mixture – I use raspberries, blueberries and blackberries."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I
want to make sure I’m getting a whole lot."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And then I’ll use about one to
two tbsp."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",of vinegar.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And do the two tbsp.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","every day for let’s say no more
than 10 days."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",You’re going to have to cut it down to one tbsp.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","a day for maybe
five days and then you go back to two tbsp."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","for 10 days – and just rotate it
like that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If you just have a lot of vinegar you’re going to stop digesting
some of those foods – stop absorbing them."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: It depends on the person – one tbsp.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",probably if you’re smaller set?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Unless you’re very heavy set – you can add two.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And then I’ll have about a tbsp.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",of honey and then sometimes two tbsp.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","if
I’m having four cups."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And I’ll either have half a cup of milk or half a cup
of whey."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: (Inaudible).
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: I’ll sip it throughout the day – I’ll have like two ounces at a time
maybe every 20 minutes – and that’s in between eating my cheese – I have
my cheese every 20 minutes."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Ok – do you have a question, Ann?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: (Inaudible).
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: You have to eat pineapple on a regular basis.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I use a thin slice, it equals
about a third of a cup – three ounces by volume of pineapple in that mixture."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Pineapple and coconut cream is very helpful to help break it down, but the body
will never do it properly without hot baths."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If you’re going to break down the
lymphatic waste under the skin it takes about 45 minutes at 105 degrees staying
temperature, so a hot tub is very necessary."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What was the question – I couldn’t hear?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: She asked about relieving lymphatic congestion.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, ok."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: If you want to get rid of lymphatic congestion that means you want to get
the lymphatic system clear of the congestion – that takes a 90 minute bath a
day at about 105 degrees."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And it’s hard to do that – people have difficulty
staying in a hot tub that long – so I say watch a movie and have a bowl of ice
water running next to you with ice cubes floating in it and a wash cloth – sit
that on top of your head – stick your hand – you know, fist in there up to
your wrists – two minutes – you’ll want to stay in the tub."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It
automatically cancels out wanting to get out of the tub."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So – and that’s the
way it stays."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Some people if they’re very overweight they get heat prostration
quickly – they may have to do that every 10-15 minutes, so normally a person
does that once every 20 minutes."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Does massage help at all?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Massage won’t really do anything for that – it’ll cause a breakage in
the lymphatic and make it worse."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","True lymphatic massage to me is a tickle, so it
electrically moves things – so you’re tickling them."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You know how sometimes
you get tickled?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","That’s driving the electricity in the system – in a blocked
system."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","When you’re ticklish or you’re very sensitive to touch like that,
that means your lymphatic system is blocked – and the neurological system."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And
a lot of that energy is charged up under your skin."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, taking the hot baths,
getting tickle massages helps to relieve that again."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: You know in your book you say 102-106.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Now you’re saying 105 – so, has
that changed?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah – I’m changing it, yeah."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I just wanted it to be safe.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Originally it
was 110 – that’s a typo."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: It was supposed to be 101 to start off slow.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You know, with the 110, so –

G: That’s really tough, man – being in there and sat for about 10 minutes
and you get your knees in, so –

A: Like I say: Take that bowl of cold water with you and you stick your fists
all the way up to your wrists in there and put a cold cloth on top of your head
– you’ll want to stay in there."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",It won’t be tough.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Ice pack is not as good – just an ice pack?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Ice pack is a little too cold.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Yeah, because I put an ice pack and it really just does my head in – I
just felt awful."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, you don’t do that – you got to put a towel up there – at least
double the towel on top if you’re going to use an ice pack."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Now Aajonus, you say it’s a 105, but does that mean you’re sitting in
the tub?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Because I’ve taken my temperature – if I’m sitting up I can have
it 105 and half of me is up and I can take it, but at 102 I have to be in the
tub to get just my nose just sticking out and my mouth, right."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, when you say
105 do you mean you’re –

A: Your whole body should be under."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, your body temperature’s got to be near a 105 then?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, it won’t be 105 because the body will always cools itself by three
degrees minimum."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: I’ve had my body temperature almost – when I had the tub at 102 –
I’ve had my body temperature a half a degree below that – 101 and a half."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, but once you go above 102 it won’t elevate – even if you’re 105
degrees – the body’s not going to get hotter than 102 except under the skin."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If you take your temperature under the arm you’re going to be almost as hot as
the water, but if you stick it in your rectum or in your mouth, you’re going
to be about 102 in a 105 degrees."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, what’s the minimum body temperature you want it to be then?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: I don’t worry about body temperature – I worry about the 105 degrees
I’ve found consistently because the body needs that to do –

G: Of the water, right?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: The water has to be 105 degrees.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: I have a sauna.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Sauna’s a dry heat and – minimum is a 137 in one of those infrareds –
still too hot."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You start to destroy the enzymes and mucous membranes managing
the cells at 110-112 degrees, so you’re damaging the mucous membranes by being
in a sauna or a steam bath."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You cannot go over 110 degrees because it will
destroy the enzymes and vitamins in your skin."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: How long do you leave the ice cubes?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Two minutes.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: No, I’m talking about out of the freezer."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You take the ice packs at the
tub –

A: Yeah, you take cold water, you put ice cubes in it and you leave it out –
you leave it at the tub with you."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","As long as there’s ice cubes that water
going to stay cold."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",If the ice cubes melt then it’s not going to stay cold.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: I’ve been having trouble finding a thermometer for the water – I don’t
know where to go."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: A bowl thermometer’s good.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: (Inaudible).
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Who’s?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What’s it called?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: I use a drug store thermometer.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Swimming pool.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Ok do you have a question, Gill?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: I’m hearing a lot of talk about arsenic: How do you get rid of it; how do
you keep it from (Inaudible)?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: It’s difficult because they’re putting in arsenic in all grains because
it makes the animals fat – they swell up; they gain more weight."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Arsenic is
very toxic – the body’s gaining fat to protect itself from the arsenic
poisons."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","They also use it as a pesticide to keep moths and rodents out of the
grain fills."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, they are fed commercial grains and they have arsenic in it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So,
I stopped eating – even Amos today (Inaudible) and he does feed them a
processed fish meal which has arsenic in it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What are we going to do about our (Inaudible) this winter that are coming?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: I said in winter time I don’t eat eggs or chicken.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Well then what do you eat?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: I just eat only meat now.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I stopped eating fish because of Fukushima and the
radiation."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: You heard about the Santa Monica sea food?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Santa Monica sea food?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: You said last time that you eat the Santa Monica sea food.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: That was before Fukushima.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: But that was the last problem.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, I said if you eat deep sea fish – certain ones are probably ok, but I
don’t even trust it now because the radiation levels getting higher every
week."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What about Atlantic fish?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Atlantic – you’ve got the (Inaudible) travelling up from the Gulf,
constantly seeping."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Oysters are the only safe things to eat?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, not even those."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I will not eat any sea food unless I’m in the
Philippines, or (Inaudible) or somewhere around there because the Fukushima
comes east to America."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",It’s hasn’t got down to the Philippines yet.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: What about the oysters – they’ve got a hard shell – they’re not
going to go into that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: They absorb it in the shell.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Well, the oysters will absorb it into the
shells; clams and mussels will absorb it into the meat and shell."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Well then it’s ok for me to get the blue clam oysters, isn’t it?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: I said I don’t know – that’s the way it used to be, but I haven’t
tested any oysters since I’ve returned."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You can break open the meat and test
it with a Geiger counter and see if there are radioactive isotypes in the oyster
meat."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: For the chickens – is that across the board in the whole of the United
States?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: When my Amish Farmers are feeding the chickens commercial feed – that’s
the limit."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, then we have very little to eat – just beef in the morning and –

A: That’s right – yep."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Dairy and fruit.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Giving the scraps for your own chickens.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Wonderful.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Giving it your chickens is wonderful – you’re not feeding
them arsenic."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But anytime you buy a feed from anywhere unless it’s an organic
farmer that doesn’t store his feed – there’s going to be arsenic in it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: (Inaudible).
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah – well, I just grew my grains."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I got 210 ninety pound bags of rice
for my Thailand property."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Now I’ll feed that to my worker.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","He does not leave
my property."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",What they do is they build a shit house – literally.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","They take
cow shit and mud and then make the walls that way – it keeps out the rats and
everybody else."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, it’s really a shit house."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, they’ve got grass on there
and they coat it to plaster and they plaster it with cow shit and mud."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: When is the winter starting for Amos’ farm?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: He starts feeding them somewhere around mid-late December.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Then I don’t
eat anything until May – no eggs or chickens – unless they promise me
there’s not any."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","They cut their own food they have to use arsenic in it –
they’re not buying from any store."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, they buy it from a local farmer who has
to put it on the market and he’s organic grain foods."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And from what I
understand they’re all using commercial feed grains now."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: That’s just four months.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, that’s four months at best."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: To May?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: June through December.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And you know, you have to get on Amos’ and Eli’s
case and say: “Hey, grow your own stuff instead of getting it someplace
else.”"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Or we stop buying it – that’s all?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, and they lose a lot of money."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: You can’t make that drink – that berry drink that you gave for vaccines?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: That’ll help, but you’ve got other toxins to deal with."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Arsenic is not
easy – arsenic is a very dangerous poison; it causes heart attacks; it causes
liver failure – it causes all kinds of problems."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Arsenic is a very dangerous
substance."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, if you get organic grain is it going to have arsenic in it too?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Could be if you buy commercial – you have to test it.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Mine doesn’t of
course, but I don’t sell mine – it feeds my workers and my cows."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And of
course –

G: If you go to someone who grows their grains and say: “Look, I want your
feed –

A: Absolutely, yeah."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And if I were going to eat rice – which I don’t – I
would store it in big jars of glass."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Moths can’t breathe in there –
there’s no oxygen for them and so you tack it and keep it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",No rats.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Well, let me put it this way: When I was in the desert I had a jar of
nuts and seeds – the wild rats would actually unscrew the jars – actually
unscrew the jar."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I had to put lock caps on them – literally."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",They do consider the rat the smartest animal next to the human.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I think
they’re smarter than human – rats don’t go around poisoning each other for
profit."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Do you have a question?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Yeah, I’ve pulled a muscle in the shoulder?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Anything other than hot water
bottles; lubrication formula?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, when you pull a muscle that means you’ve torn – you have lesions
in it – you’ve torn the muscle."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Then, you do like boxers and put raw meat on
it and a hot water bottle."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Also –

G: Hot water bottle and meat at the same time?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yes.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","With meat on, then the hot water bottle – but, it’s better if you
put just a little bit of honey and butter mixture on the meat – just a thin
layer and then butter on the one side, a thin cloth over that – cotton or silk
– and then a piece of plastic over that, and then an ace bandage over that, so
it doesn’t dry out."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","That way you can keep using the same piece of meat for two
to three days until it stinks."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I will use it beyond stinks – I don’t give a
shit because it will heal much faster if it’s decaying meat."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I will just
use it until I can’t stand it and I can’t sleep then I don’t use it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Then
I’ll change the meat."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And if you do that usually a torn muscle will heal in about 12 days.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It will
still take about six weeks - normally it takes about a year and a half."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Anything internally?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Pineapple’s helpful, to get rid of the foreign tissue."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Not a lot of
pineapple, but if you have a little bit all day long."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Like in the mixture I said
with the berries, only if you have pineapple."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And just sip it throughout the day
and you’ll heal a little bit faster because the bromelain in the pineapple
will help break down the dead cells that will bruise and damage the calf."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Ok?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Do you have a question?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: When I was very young I had a case of pneumonia and to save my life they
chocked me full of antibiotics."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, forever after I’ve had serious killer
migraines."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Even since that pneumonia antibiotic incident.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, nobody has deadly pneumonia – you’re just very sick."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But the
pharmaceutical industry – the medical industry - are terrorists, so they’ll
get you to take anything that they believe."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And they’re taught to be that
stupid – they don’t observe – they’re just taught to panic and react;
they’re not taught to experiment and observe."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","They’re not allowed to
experiment – that’s against the law."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","The laws of the AMA who follow the
pharmaceutical industry’s advice – they write all the procedure manuals."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If
you don’t follow the pharmaceutical industry’s advice, you are breaking the
AMA law."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, they get punished."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, they follow what they’re told and they’re told to be terrorists."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So,
what happens when you take an antibiotic for five days?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You lose one percent of
all bodily functions."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",The body is 99.99% bacteria.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Antibiotics destroy all
bacteria – in a five day cycle you lose one percent of the body’s abilities."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Every five days you take off a whole percent.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","To recover on a good diet it takes
about two years to recover one percent – two years."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If you do this optimal
diet of mine and eat high meat you can get over it quicker."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","The bowel is the
area that feeds the brain and the nervous system."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, the bacteria in your colon
has never recovered and the only way you can get it to recover is to implant a
high meat juice in to your rectum and then massage it in and let it distribute
it in there."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Or, eat lots of high meat – like probably (Inaudible) times a day
for three months and then the problem will all be restored within another five
months and you have to do it for three months again."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If you implant it in your
rectum and you massage and you do your belly roll to make it go into your system
up into the whole colon, that one implant of about three ounces of that high
meat juice can keep you going for three months – just one time."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Can you swallow high meat instead of chew it?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah – yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",High meat’s pre-digested – you don’t have to chew it.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What kind of jars are you asking us to put it in?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Glass.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: No – I know glass, but what size of jars?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Depending on how much you want to make and how much you intend to use.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Now, don’t fill it to the top?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, only half full always."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Half full?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You need an air space in there – you need both aerobic and anaerobic
bacteria."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: I just read that we have bacterial DNA in our DNA which our nearest relative
animal don’t have; that we have something unique."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, a lot of us don’t have it anymore because of vaccines."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Don’t have what?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: This particular DNA that other animals don’t have.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Oh.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Pig has almost identical to what we have.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, what does the antibiotics have to do with the migraines and (Inaudible)?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: The brain and the nervous system are fed from the colon.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Her colon bacteria
was wiped out."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","The brain is not getting the food it needs, so it swells."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","The
brain is constantly swollen because it’s trying to get all the nutrients and
they can never get all the amino acids because she’s not digesting properly
– that causes constant brain swelling."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, ok."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: I’m sorry I didn’t explain that – I’m glad you asked.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You didn’t
understand that until I said that too, right?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Probably nobody did.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: I did.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Sometimes I say things – come to conclusions.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Is there any other way to treat the brain swelling?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Any additional way?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Only way you can do is feed the nervous system properly and that’s by
eating high meat if you don’t digest properly in the colon."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","See, all that food
is digested – it feeds every part of the body in to the small intestines."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Once
it gets in to the colon you’re getting to the finite particle breakdown – it
feeds the brain and nervous system – the neuron cells and the neurological
cells."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, that is a whole process in itself – that’s a very short trap."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","That very long small intestines feeds everything else in the body – that colon
is strictly for the nervous system and brain."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If it is not operating you can
have migraines, you can have autism and it can have all kinds of problems."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And
it maybe unrelated to mercury at all – the brain is just a vision –
depending on what kind of antibiotics you got."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Tetracycline was a bad one – I
mean it caused so much ADD – it was amazing."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: (Inaudible).
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, the brain."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Yeah, I was of the view that I did lots of tetracycline or
cocaine."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Yeah, I actually just told my Mom that I it was from lots of tetracycline
when I was inside her."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Oh, no."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What is that – an antibiotic?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yes, an antibiotic – that was 60’s – came out in the 60’s."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Late
August 60’s, to 70’s, early 80’s."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: That was in the 50’s wasn’t it?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: That was just beginning to use it intravenously.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: They did it in the military though.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Oh, yeah."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",They were doing that first.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: How do you make high meat juice?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: You let it go long enough – you leave it out.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","When it starts juicing at
the bottom – turns into black juice – that’s completely digested –
completely – absolutely digestible liquid."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",One tsp.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","of that can make you as
happy as a (Inaudible)."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Can you put it garlic in there?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Like garlic or something to make it taste
better?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, you can put it in milk."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It’s better if you just drink and wash it
down with milk."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Like a tsp.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",in an ounce of milk?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, you can do that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Or, just take a tsp."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",and wash it down with milk.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: If you leave it in your mouth some of that’s going to go right to the
(Inaudible) during the meat meal and you get happy."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If you leave it in your
mouth for two minutes you’re going to get silly."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Aajonus, do you have any of that juice available that (Inaudible)."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: I would be in jail.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: How long does it take to get to drink – how many days?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, if you leave it out at room temperature and you’re exposing it to
some light – not direct light – and you’re opening it and the meat’s not
dry it will start breaking down pretty quickly, but it takes a while – maybe
six weeks."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: For what – the juice?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, it starts shrivelling juice."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Just open it up and close it in the house?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, you want to take it outside."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: But you don’t want to open it as often even though it’s outside of the
refrigerator."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I still will open every three of four days.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You want anaerobic
bacteria rather than aerobic bacteria."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Part 2 of Transcript for Audio Recording of Aajonus’ Question & Answer
Session to Attendees of a Primal Potluck

Date: November 18, 2012

Transcriber: Colin

Location: Carlsbad, California

A = Aajonus

A: Joseph."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Uh-huh?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Do you have a question?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: No.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Do you have a question?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",You.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I just want to know your opinion on alcohol.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Okay, there are many types of alcohol: there’s ethyl alcohol that you
massage with – very dangerous alcohol; it’s made from petroleum – gasoline
– and it will eat into your skin."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A massage therapist put that on her hands
and was coming at me and I said: “No you don’t – that is a poison."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Would
you drink it?” “"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","No, you don’t drink this.”"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I said: “Your cells are
drinking it and I don’t want that on my skin.”"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I had to get her to get
some coconut oil to take it off of her hands before she came in and massage me."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, ethyl alcohol is a dangerous alcohol; it’s a distilled alcohol that comes
from gasoline."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","When you have an alcohol, let’s say, like a hard liquor: it’s distilled."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",It’s like gasoline or kerosene – it will penetrate a cell.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","The cell has no
choice – it’s going to penetrate it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Just like if you put gasoline or
kerosene on your arm – it would eat right into your arm the same way."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Any kind
of distilled alcohol is penetrating and the cell has no choice – it’s going
to damage cells."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Wine is the only one that they do not – mostly – they do not pasteurize.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Let’s say if the crop of grapes got a fungus on it then they would pasteurize
that wine."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It would be an inferior wine; a cheap wine – you wouldn’t even
like the taste of it probably."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Only cheap winos drink that.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But a wine that is
not distilled and that’s raw – it’s still going to do some damage to your
nervous system, your nerve cells, your neurons and your brain and your liver."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Because your liver, believe it or not, doesn’t have much fat."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","The liver and
the heart are almost all protein."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You have little fat deposits around the liver,
but not very much."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Around the heart you have a pocket of fat on the top of it as
a reserve to protect it from anything, like alcohol."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Your brain, of course,
shuts down when you have alcohol – even raw alcohol."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It shuts off your
discerning centers because it doesn’t want to damage those."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You’ll lose your
controls."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, that’s why people get uninhibited because it shuts off those
control centers."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And uninhibited is fine if you’re anal retentive, but of
course we’re all anal retentive because we’re trained to be that way."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But,
we’re also overly cautious in the wrong way."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, like I said in my book: two
oz.,"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","four oz.,"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","as long as you’ve eaten a lot of butter and cheese like the
French used to do."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","The French would always have appetizers with the little cakes
or crackers or something like that, and then put butter on that or a
cheese/butter sauce on top of that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And then they would have their wine during
the meal."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, they had all of this cheese and fat there to bind with that
alcohol so it didn’t do nerve damage and didn’t damage the pancreas, the
liver, and the heart and brain."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, alcohol is not a good thing."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You can eat some without having too much
damage if you’re eating the butter and cheese before you drink it, but you
have to be very careful."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: How long before you drink it?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Should be at least 15 minutes, 20 minutes."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: 15 minutes before you eat and drink?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, before you drink alcohol – if you’re going to drink wine."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Now, we used to have a raw beer."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Most beers in the world are raw except in this
country – they all have to be pasteurized, as of 1987."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Coors was the only one
– out of Colorado at the time – was the only one that was raw."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And then the
FDA said in 1987 you’ve got to stop – you’ve got to pasteurize your beer."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Coors went downhill after that and then Millers bought Coors.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",There’s no more raw beers allowed in this country.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Why is that?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Because the FDA say it’s – it’s not –

G: Oh, because it would be fermented?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: In fact there would be fermentation and bacteria in it – live and active.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Which is a good thing, but they don’t want you to have a good thing."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Like the high class European beers?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",They’re not going to be heated?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: They have to be to be heated to be brought into this country.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: No, the ones in Europe."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Oh, yeah – there’s a lot of them."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You have to check now because the
World Health Organization is really an arm of the American Medical Association
and the Pharmaceutical Industry."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, they’re talking countries into beginning
to pasteurize this, that and everything."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, you have to be careful – you have
to find out."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Most of your German beers – they say: “Screw you – we’re
not going to pasteurize our beers.”"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What about Heineken?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Heineken?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",It’s pasteurized.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: In this country?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: In this country, yeah – to be brought into the country."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If you get
Heineken in Germany it’s raw."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Not really raw, but it’s –

G: It’s from Amsterdam in Holland."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, Holland."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Well, Holland I don’t know how Holland is; I haven’t
studied Holland for that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Holland was the only one that wouldn’t let me take my milk on board.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I’ve
got a Doctor’s letter for my bone cancer that says I have to take a ½ gallon
milk on with me and all these other foods."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And in Holland they said: “Take out
all this other food on there, but you can’t take the milk.”"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I had to
down a quart ½ of milk."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I downed it right there in front of them.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And then I
held it – I didn’t allow myself to pee, so I keep recycling the nutrients
because I had to fly from Holland to England."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","The flight that I was supposed to
get from Finland to England was cancelled when I got to the airport, so I had to
go to Air France – take a flight to Holland and then from Holland to the UK
because I had a workshop to do the next day in Antigua in the Bahama Islands, in
the Antilles."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I had to get there by a certain hour."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I was hopping planes
all over."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Holland wouldn’t let me on, so I had no milk in England."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I’m
holding my pee, I refuse to pee, I’m just recycling my pee inside."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And I
didn’t pee until I got milk in Antigua."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, if you don’t pee you’ll recycle it?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: You’ll recycle your – yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: I’m going to stop peeing.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: You can drink it, but it doesn’t taste that good – it leaves an odd
smell in your mouth."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Yeah, but why drink it when you can just recycle it?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, just recycle it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Doesn’t urine contain a lot of toxins?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: No.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Just remember, as I’ve said a thousand million times: your urinary
tracts and bowels are not your waste centers – your skin is your waste center."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","The urine is nothing other than the blood with ammonia and without the red and
white blood cells."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If you urinated all the time your red and white blood cells
you’d be anemic and in miserable shape."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, the kidney manufactures ammonia
and ammonia reacts to red and white blood cells like two south ends of a magnet."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, the red and white blood cells don’t move into the kidney because of the
ammonia."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, everything that’s in urine is what’s in your blood: it’s
feeding your blood cells – feeding the red and white blood cells."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, your
blood should be pure – not toxic."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: And what about feces?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Does that contain toxins?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Feces is not supposed to be a toxin either.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, if you eat cheese and it absorbs toxins –

A: Then that will be toxic."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Where does it go?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: It will go out the feces.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, that will."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, you’re forcing it to be a detoxifier."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: And I will use that as a detoxifier, but normally when you have feces it’s
only not completely digested food."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You look at a cow, a horse or anybody
they’ve only digested 67% of their grasses; insects will get in there, dogs,
and they’ll eat up the rest."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And even humans will eat feces from cows in
certain countries because they don’t have enough protein."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, when it’s gone
through the digestive tract of a cow, or a horse, or a goat or sheep it’s 67%
digested."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Then, all of a sudden you can act as a vegetarian, but you’re eating
a shit vegetarian diet – literally."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And you can… People in Georgia, Russia lived on – the poor people who were
basically field workers - ate buffalo shit and thrived on it because it was
pre-digested."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","The cellulose was broken down, so that they can start digesting
the fats and the proteins from it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, when you have a bowel movement – you
see dogs eating human shit."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","All these animals – insects – all kinds of
creatures – will eat feces."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","In the ocean, crustaceans eat feces."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","That’s what
they’re built to eat; that’s what they’re intended to eat and it makes
them healthy."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But remember, feces is just supposed to be food that’s not
completely digested; it’s not supposed to be toxic."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Your toxins are supposed
to leave through the skin after they’re reduced to a liquid substance by the
lymphatic system."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But like I said: with all the trans-fatty acids and all the
plastic fats, lymph systems are just jammed."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, they can’t get rid of those
toxins through their skin until they get into a hot tub that’s 105 to 110
degrees for 90 minutes a day."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Can you sweat a lot naturally?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",That’s good?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yes, it’s good, but you’re not going to get rid of those trans-fatty
acids."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You have to get the body up to 105 to 110 degrees to do that – to melt
that stuff out of there."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It’s just like people say: “Well, a rebounder’s
good for the lymphatic system.”"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I said: “If you took a cold stick of butter
in a cold glass and you jump for ½ hour, do you think that butter’s going to
melt?”"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","No, it’s not going to melt."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, you can bounce on that forever."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","As
long as that is cold and solid it’s not going to – you can be out there 50
degrees – 60 degrees weather and you can bounce for five days in a row and
that butter is not going to melt."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","The trans-fatty acids – the plastic oils in
your body – will not get into a fluid system to move through those pores until
it’s reached 105-108 degrees."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, the heat actually makes those oils less viscous?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: They can move through the pore.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, the lymph?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, not the lymph – the lymph reduces it to a substance to be able to put
through the pore if it’s the right temperature."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It’s up to your body to heat
up."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Fevers are good – fevers are wonderful to relieve stuff.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, the hot tub
is the best."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Now, when I had my hot tub I would just go to sleep in it – I
would sleep four, six hours in my hot tub every night."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I’d made my sleep-time
in the hot tub."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: When you were so sick?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, not even just sick – I mean when I moved from that house two years
ago – two ½ years ago, when the city kicked me out."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I’d sleep in it.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I’d
have my milk and my Sports Formula in there – sip on it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I’d wake up after
40 minutes or 30 minutes, drink some, go right back to sleep."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Sometimes, I’d
sleep for straight two hours."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: The chlorine and fluoride in the water?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: I had well water.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, I’ve said in We Want to Live: I talk about the
baths in there under Health Modalities."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I tell you to put raw unpasteurized
apple cider vinegar, milk, sea salt and coconut cream in the water if you want
to neutralize the poisons."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Seven minutes before you get into the water.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: And then when you’re heating the water back up you drain the tub first and
then you put the hot water –

A: No, you drain two inches."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Two inches, right."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Yes, two inches."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And then you add more water and you keep
doing that – do you add more sea salt, and vinegar and –

A: I’ve found that you didn’t have to."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Yeah, it just kind of spreads or whatever."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: The two inches that you’re adding back and dispersing it as your –
because you’re just adding scalding water in and moving the hot water like
this – it’s doesn’t – it’s already absorbing those toxins – the milk
that’s already in there."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I mean you can put in a lot.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Like, when I was in
Cincinnati – I got there on Thursday night and I hadn’t had a bath in two
weeks and I thought: “I better take a bath.”"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And the water is slippery.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It
was so full of fluoride."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I mean it’s like oil – it’s oil-based.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I put
a whole quart of milk in the bath tub."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","That much fluoride is going to take more
nutrients."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","That’s a lot of fluoride when it’s slippery like that – oily
almost."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Really bad.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Okay, who else is back there that has a question?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Yes, back there first?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Osteoporosis.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: I’ve fully healed it.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Uh, she asked about osteoporosis."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Osteoporosis is a
thinning of the bone."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You lose minerals – mainly calcium, phosphorous,
potassium and magnesium - the alkalizing parts of the bone, which constitutes
about 2/3 of the bone."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, your body starts using that in other areas because
you’re not eating the proper foods to get it out of those alkalizing minerals."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, your body starts leaching from its own bone – that’s osteoporosis."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","To
relieve that, you eat three times a day."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I’ve taken people who’ve been as
much as 32% bone loss – women mainly – 32% bone loss, which is considered
severe."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","That’s when you start cracking everything – you have a fall and you
break your hip bone."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",What I have them do is have two tbsp.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","of cheese three times
daily with one ½ to two tsp."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",honey.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Can you repeat that again?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: It’s two tbsp.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",raw no salt cheese with one ½ to two tsp.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",honey.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And the
honey and the cheese have to go down the throat together, so you can mash them
or put the honey and the cheese in your mouth at the same time."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Now, when you
eat anything dehydrated there are no bio-active enzymes."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Food will not digest
properly without leaching nutrients from some other area of your body."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","However,
honey is mainly enzymes for digestion."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, when you eat the honey with the
cheese you provide yourself with the nutrients to digest the cheese."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Because it
is so concentrated it’s like taking this much milk and reducing it to this and
concentration of minerals."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","When you eat it with the honey mainly it’s the
minerals – it’s a mineral supplement."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It would be like taking a bottle of
rock minerals that you will never digest anyway because we don’t digest rock
minerals."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But in cheese form, those minerals are already in food form."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","We just
add the bioactive enzymes of honey back to it and then we have a digestible food
which should replace the bone very quickly."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Now, the one person I was talking about that came in – the 32% bone loss –
she reversed it in 20 months."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Would you also add butter?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: You don’t have to – you can.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If the person is very thin and fat
deficient I would say have butter with it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Thank you.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: You’re welcome.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Okay, yours now?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: I have a scar on my chest from 15-years-old.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It’s growing larger and
larger, very, very sporadically."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Chelating.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Yeah, chelating."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",It’s incredibly sensitive.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I can taste Acutane around the
time that this showed up."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And, I mean I’ve done everything as far as I know
– I don’t take a lot of things to take this down because it is very
sensitive."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Basically it’s cancerous tumor.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, you put pineapple – take a little
piece of pineapple over there, rub it on only once a day."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Next day you put raw
apple cider vinegar on there."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Next day, pineapple."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Next day, apple cider vinegar
and let it eat away at it a little at a time."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, there’s no use putting dead
cells there that you’re not dissolving in the body – just building there."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It’s better on the skin, than in the lungs, in your lymphatic system, or any
of the liver, glands or any of those – better right there."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I’ve seen it and
I’ve had a lot of people who have had their cancer right here."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Now what about mixing the apple cider vinegar with clay?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Not a good idea.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Not a good idea?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, because the clay is going to rip the fats out of it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","The fats need to
react with the apple cider vinegar or you’re going to damage the tissue."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Okay, so just pineapple, apple cider vinegar and rotate them?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Is there a brand of vinegar you recommend?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Solana Gold.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Solana Gold – S-O-L-A-N-A – is the only one that’s aged
in wood and stored in wood."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What about Bragg’s?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",You don’t want us to use anymore?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: I never said Bragg’s – I’ve been with Solana Gold for 10 years.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, Bragg’s you get –

A: Bragg’s ages theirs in wood, but stores it in stainless steel."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh no, I’ve been using –

A: Bragg’s used to do it the way Solana Gold is, but they sold Solana Gold
their extra wooden barrels."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: I’ve been using it.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Would it do any harm to you?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: When Bragg died his daughter took it over and changed the whole process.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: I know, but I’ve been using it for the last so many years."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, still it’s better than Hain’s or any of the others, but Solana
Gold is the best."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: For what it’s worth, they don’t store it anymore in oak."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","They do ferment
it, but I talked to Solana Gold because I’m going to try and get in our food
buying club and she said we store it in stainless steel now."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: They did?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",When did they start doing that?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: She didn’t announce as to when the date was they changed, but she said we
just don’t have enough capacity to store it in the wood that long."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, we
can’t sell it immediately after we ferment it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, there’s no difference between Bragg and Solana Gold then."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: I have to say: when you look at Bragg’s vinegar compared to Solana Gold
there’s a big difference in the color and the mother on the bottom."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I mean,
Solana looks so much more concentrated and filled with so much more nutrients."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, Bragg claims that they don’t filter it, but I’ve seen them filter
it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: I think they do.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: It’s a weaker vinegar.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, it doesn’t have much mother and it doesn’t have much peptin in it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Yeah, it doesn’t have much of the mother."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: There’s another brand out there too that Erewhan sells.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It’s another
vinegar."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It also said raw, unfiltered."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I forgot to get the name.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Is it clear or is it really foggy like Solana Gold?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: I’ll have to look at it again.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, if it’s really foggy it’s better."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Now, Aajonus?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yes, Jim."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: I just wanted to ask this gentleman over here if he could take pictures
every day."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Would you mind taking a picture –

G: I don’t mind."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: When you start on this thing?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What do you say – every day or so?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Is it going to be noticeably changed?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, it takes time."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, what, about once a week?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, let’s say he takes a picture once every two weeks."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Okay, yeah, I’d appreciate that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Yeah, people need to know about this."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Of
course, yeah, okay."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: And if it gets really sore – if it starts seeping or bleeding – you have
to cut out the pineapple."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Just put the vinegar on it.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Will it also help if I take this internally as well?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, definitely, but usually on the skin it has to be on the surface."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: And that’s assuming he’s on a regular raw diet?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Do you have a question?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Yes, I have three children: 14-years-old, 12 and 9."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","By the time I realized
vaccines and injections were bad for you, my first child – son – had gone
pretty much through the whole course of all those injections, accept the
(Inaudible)."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: So, he had injections all the way up to 15-years-old?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: No, he’s 14 now."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Up to 12-years-old – 11 – 12 – 11.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: So, he didn’t have all of them?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Not all of them.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","The (Inaudible) that’s required in middle school – I
didn’t let him have that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, the other two children have less of those
vaccinations."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","They still have some, but less."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Uh-huh.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Physically he’s really good, everything, he’s doing very in his school
– very, very well."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, he’s very nervous – constantly needs attention."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Very insecure – he needs to hear that we love him all the time and that what
he’s doing is not wrong and all this thing."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And he’s trouble making friends.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Is he thin?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: No, he’s not thin."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: What kind of fat is he eating?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Well, I try to feed him raw butter as much as I can."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I try to feed him at
least one glass of milk every morning."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",He eats a lot of junk of course.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: How about milkshakes?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: I do them as often as I can, yeah."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, he gets fed a lot of junk at school."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, the only way you can counter that is to get him to eat a lot of cheese
to absorb those poisons and he needs to exercise."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: He does – he goes to soccer at least three times a week.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: He may have – let’s say he has 11 activity rings in his eyes – that
means he produces hormones for physical activity for 11 to 12 hours daily."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I had one couple bring me their – 13 ½ at the time – and I ask people not
to tell me their problem – I want to tell them what I see."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I don’t want
to be – have my mind working on what they’ve already told me."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Because my
mind will do that; my mind will work on as much information as it can get."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And I
just want to go off of what can see in the irises."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, this couple brought the
daughter."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I shot her eyes, then she went to the back in a chair and the parents
sat right next to me and we want over the irises."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And I always read the activity
lines last."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Now, the most activity lines that I’ve ever seen before in my
professional athletes are 11."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",This girl had 14.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Whew.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: And I said: “You cannot put this girl in a regular school.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","She has 14
activity rings."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","She will never be able to focus or concentrate; they’re going
to label her as ADHD/ADD and you’re going to have a hell of a problem with
her."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","She needs to exercise 10 to 15 minutes every hour for her mind to be open
and clear.”"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And they said: “That’s why we brought her here.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","That’s what
it is.”"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And I looked back at the poor girl and I was going to ask for her idea about
that – whether she could – and she was going like this."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Wow.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: That’s how much energy that poor girl has.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And I said: “You need to put
her in a sports school, a dance school or something."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You can’t put her in a
regular school."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","They’ll just medicate her to death and then you’ll have a
vegetable on your hands.”"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, there are sports schools out there – dance
schools – there all kinds of schools."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, they put her in a school for that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","They’re fine now, but they had trouble with her for six years in school all
that time and all they needed to be told was that this chid needed to exercise
every hour."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Hmm.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A friend of mine was a teacher from New Zealand who was a Special Ed teacher.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And she got a job in Beverly Hills at a Catholic high school there and she
wasn’t even Catholic."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I thought: “Hmm, something’s really wrong there
– Catholics don’t hire non-Catholics to teach children, unless there’s
something terribly wrong.”"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, she came home, called me and she was crying,
and crying and crying."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And I said: “What’s going on?”
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","She said: “They
gave me all the worst kids in the world in the whole school – all different
grades and ages all in this one room."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And I have to deal with all of them.”
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And she said: “I couldn’t control them for even one minute.”
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I said:
“It’s very easy: take them for five minutes, let them go wild in the room
– screaming."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You have to tell the next classrooms about two ½ to five minutes
every hour."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Five minutes – they have to get through it.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Maybe they can do
something in their classroom like it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, these kids would make messes of
everything."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","They just spent five minutes cleaning it up and then I told her to
have them sit down and sing the word: Om, nine times."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And that puts the brain in
an alpha state."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Those kids were fine every day.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","They did it every hour, every
day during school."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And that’s all it took.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Those kids got top grades.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","They
were better than other kids because now the hormones for physical activity were
utilized and they weren’t clouding the mind."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And usually when the body is that
active, the mind is that active too, so you’ve got a lot of geniuses there…
just unable to function because of those physiological hormones, so it’s that
easy."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","They fired her six months later because they found out she was saying the word
Om – having the kids say the word Om – and that was the devils work."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Can you
imagine that?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And then the kids went right about within a few months back to the
same way."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I don’t get it.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Superstition.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, for the diet?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: You need to get as much milkshakes in him to calm him down as possible, the
cheese, and exercise."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And you know a little bit of exercise may be enough for
him."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",He may need a tremendous amount of exercise.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I wouldn’t know unless I saw
his eyes – how much we were dealing with."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It was his physical body –

G: They always think that’s there is something wrong with him."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: If the body has hormones and it needs to utilize and it’s not doing it the
body becomes uneasy."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If he has depression that’s something else: that’s low
bacteria in the colon."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Do you have a question?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Yeah, I was going to go back to bacteria, parasites and molds: is there any
of them we can cure at all?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Any of them that are made by the universities, the pharmaceutical industries
used by the military: the E. boli; the aids; the anthrax – those are
biological weapons."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Aids was made in 1961-62 at UCLA, discovered by Dr. Robert
Strecker and it’s all documented in the documentary: This is a Bio-attack
Alert. ["
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","http://www.umoja-research.com/bio-attack_doc.htm ]

And then Leonard Horowitz [http://www.tetrahedron.org/ ] documented how the E.
boli was made and how manufactured aids was put in the small pox vaccine in
Africa."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Out of 127M vaccines 97M people were poisoned and got the aids.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","About
27M didn’t react to it in the same way that 97M did."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, if it doesn’t come
from your food and isn’t part of your body or the earth or dirt, it’s not
safe – it’ll be dangerous – and you can only get that if you’re
injected."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Don’t let a needle get near you because you never know what’s in
it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Do you have a question, Alyson?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: I have – yeah, I do: I’ve been having some dizzy spells and I know why
– I’ve discovered that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Unfortunately, I had a problem and I figured out
what that was, but now I just need to heal my brains and to build up my brain
– and to reduce any kind of inflammation or and/or cyst or tumor that could be
in my brain."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, what are the best foods and –

A: Dizziness doesn’t come from that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: It doesn’t?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, not unless you’re on drugs."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",You high?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Because I was working on my computer and this DSL system – this block
thing – it was positioned at the back of my head and I’ve been radiating and
heating up the back of my head for nine months, or something like that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It was
progressively getting worse."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I had to get a new cell phone.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","My old cell phone
was really dying."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",All the new cell phones are very high EMF.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I used this one new
cell phone – that Samsung Galaxy 3 – and it’s making my hand hurt and a
pain going up my arm."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And I’m trying to do a text on it and I can feel it go
ugh-ugh-ugh in my head."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I’m not using that phone anymore."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, just
whatever I can do heal my brain and to reduce any kind of inflammation, perhaps."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, the brain mainly uses cream."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Cream, okay?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: So, you’ve got to have little amounts of cream frequently."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: My body like cream too.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And that’ll mean you’re going to swell some, but you have to deal
with it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, that’s fine."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",My body likes cream – really likes cream.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I mean I used
to love the raw ice-cream – I used to get it at Rawesome."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: I drank two cups the day before yesterday and two cups yesterday –
literally."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I would eat honey – the honeycomb – you know there’s the
honeycomb."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And yesterday I did it with blueberries – you know, blueberries and
cream – chew the blueberries and the cream."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If I just drink the cream I’ll
get heavy."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I need some of those enzymes to help digest that much cream.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I
normally recommend that nobody drink more than half a cup of cream at a time,
unless you’ve got serious help in digesting it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, like raw eggs smoothies with some cream?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Usually, if you want to do that honey and cream is better –

G: Oh, just honey and cream."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: For your brain.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, yeah?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: The honey and cream.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: You blend it?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, no, no – you just put a little honey in your mouth, put the cream in
there – let’s say a tbsp. –"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",maybe an 1/8 of a tsp.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","of honey in there and a
¼ tsp."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",of honey in there with a tbsp.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","of cream at a time and just mix it all
together, swallow it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And you can have ½ cup day like that, for about 10 days."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And you’ll cut that right out.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: If you really think you have got an abscess in your brain because the
electromagnetic field got disrupted and damaged your tissue, then you need to
eat the detoxification – the bacterial lowering formula."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Which is like three
oz lime juice, two oz honey, two tsp."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","lemon juice, three tbsp."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","coconut cream,
three tbsp."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",dairy cream and a tsp.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",vinegar – raw apple cider vinegar.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: That’s what again?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: That’s for reducing bacterial, parasitical, fungal – detoxifications."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Would that have (Inaudible) for reducing that?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, this is – most often – you’ve got one ear filling and not the
other; one ear’s getting too much water."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: I mean, I can even hear it in my bed."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: That’s too much water in one ear.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, the ear where you hear the ocean, or
humming, or buzzing, or ringing – that’s where you need to put the hot water
bottle at that ear, so you can perspire – get some of that water out of that
ear."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, if you will keep filling it and filling it, it’ll keep detoxifying,
so you may have to do that every day."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, okay."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: If the other ear starts ringing then you need to put it on that for that
night and the other ear."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: I need the hot water bottle.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I love the hot water bottle.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",It’s so amazing.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: They are.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: It’s a great – excellent tool – it’s amazing.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Thank you.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Okay, Roger – do you have a question?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Yes.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I perspire very little.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Is this a problem and what should I do about
it?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: You need to eat more, gain 30 to 40 pounds, so you can afford to hold more
fluids and perspire."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Right now, you don’t have much fluid."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Well, I’m working a lot during the day."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, do you drink a lot of water?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Uh.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: If you drink water that’s not going to help you.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: No, I drink mineral water."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: That’s not going to help you.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: And ice tea.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: That doesn’t help you.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: A little coffee now and then.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Doesn’t help you.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Do you drink milk?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: I do.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A drink about a little over a quart a day.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, drink two quarts and stop drinking the other stuff."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And drink
vegetable juice instead of the tea."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Well, I drink a couple vegetable juices a day."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Okay, you’re a tall guy – you can drink three quarts."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I drink two quarts
a day, minimum."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: That’s kefir?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, not all the time."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Really?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: It’s always room temperature or warmer.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Hmm.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Most often it’s on its way, but I travel so much that I can’t keep it
into kefir form (Inaudible)."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, I never take more than two oz."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","of cold milk at
a time."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And that’s if I’ve forgotten to take it out and I thought I did.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And
I go out, have my two oz."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","of milk and I drink that over about two minutes –
you know, two oz a minute – so I have four oz."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",at a time.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And then I leave the
milk out."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","What I usually do is I’ll put it in a bowl of hot water and warm it quickly,
so I don’t have to wait so long."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I can just sip milk all day long."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Excuse me?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Is this for the vegetable juice?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",At room temperature?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Everything except vegetable juice.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I take my meat out the night before that
I’m going to eat in the morning – the meat I’m going to use during the day
and the next morning."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Actually, what I do is: I take my meat on Sunday."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I get
the big cuts – the roasts – only not roasted and I’ll cut those into inch
slices this way, flip it and cut it into inch slices this way and then inch
slices this way."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I’ve inch cubes."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Then I put those into my food processor,
so it’s no more than this much high – about an inch above the top blade."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And
then I’ll grind that for about 40 seconds, so I pate my meat."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And that’ll
make two cups."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I take these two-cup jars, stuff them almost to the top and I
do one a day and then one extra for the week – so I make eight a week."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I
do all of my meat on a Sunday for the whole week so I don’t have to deal with
that – I have time for other things."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And I make all of my foods in the morning
for the whole day."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",See that little bag down there?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I have every food until I go
to sleep at night."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And then the next morning I will make all the foods for the
day."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I don’t have to do anything with the meats because that’s already made.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If I have to do juicing then of course that day I have to spend an hour juicing,
so that’s a little extra time."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, if you want to stay on the diet and do it
well, you prepare all of your foods in the day in the morning."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Or, if you’re
doing your cheese, your eggs, your meat, or juice and then meat – during that
span you can have everything prepared."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If I do the meat on Sunday I can prepare
all of my foods for the whole day in 35 minutes."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: The whole week, you mean?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, each day I still prepare those for the day."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, the meats I do once a
week."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Do you add honey to that meat before you pate’d it?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: No.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Oh.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Why don’t you get your meat ground?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Yeah, wouldn’t that be simpler?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Your body makes hydrochloric acid to dissolve larger particles of food to
put it into a soup."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Then, the bacteria infiltrates that and then the
bacteria’s waste is our nutrients."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: No, I mean if you have ground –

A: Listen to me."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, if you have ground meat, your body still has to make a lot
of hydrochloric acid to dissolve that into a soup."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If it’s pate’d by the
time you’ve already finished mixing in saliva in your mouth it’s the soup
– your body doesn’t even have to manufacture a hydrochloric acid anywhere in
the stomach or intestines."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I sleep one to one ½ hours less when I pate my foods.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","When I eat ground meat I
still sleep 45 minutes to hour more."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If I eat – take meat and I cut it like
here – I will sleep an extra two hours tonight."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Wow.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Because my body has to make a lot of hydrochloric acid to dissolve that into
a soup for the bacteria to eat, so if you want to maximise your time and energy
don’t do something you don’t have to do – pate your meat."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: No, I’m saying if you have ground meat I still pate it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Okay, you can do that – that’s fine."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, why do you buy this?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: I buy the chunk and those other cuts because it’s sweeter to me.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","When I
have it ground at a store they use a high compression."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Marilyn sells the ground beef.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, and they use a high pressure grinder to make it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","To me it homogenizes
some of the fat molecules."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, it absorbs some of the blood in it and it takes
the sweetness away."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, when I cut them up like that and put it and pate it all
the time, that blood and the fat are all dispersed evenly."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, it tastes a
little bit better."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And I’ll make sauces with it.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","The only problem with it I
have is it raises my libido."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Except I don’t have a girlfriend here, so it’s
a little annoying because I’ll get a little horny while I’m sitting here
trying to work."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, what it is, is: you take about two large tomatoes and put
them in the middle of a quart jar, and you take one of those whole packages or
two of dill and you don’t use the stems – you use mainly the stalks on them
– the fronds on it – the tentacles."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And you put that in there with a… I
use about a thin slice of onion – about like this and about this big around."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","About 1/8th of an inch thick – maybe three thirty-seventh’s of an inch
thick."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And then I put two cloves of garlic in.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Two cloves?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Wow.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, not the whole –

G: Right."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",But still?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Little cloves.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, you’re talking about a quart of fluid here."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, a quart."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: So, then I’ll put one ½ tbsp."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",of vinegar and with that two tbsp.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","of
honey."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",It is absolutely delicious!
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And it will last for months in and around the
refrigerator."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I have been travelling with mine.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I’ve got a little bit left –
I’ve got about this much left that I’ve been eating for a month."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And I put
just a little of that on my – if I put a lot on then I’ll be really horny."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I just put a little bit on – enough to really flavor and make the pate
taste very, very nice."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Hmm.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: But, I always pack my butter with all of that, so I eat a lot of butter –
like three tbsp."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",of butter to four tbsp.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",per meat meal.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Is that in the Recipe Book?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, no."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It may be in there, but I don’t think so."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","That’s something I
came up with in the Philippines the last time I was there."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: (Inaudible).
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah – I blend it and blend it.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Hey, Aajonus – you said don’t eat double ground beef."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, if you pate
it – is that okay to buy double ground beef, or not?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: When you put the double ground beef through the high-compressor it
homogenizes all the fat."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",It’s not under high pressure in a food processor.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: No, but earlier you said to Kathy: single ground you can use that to pate
it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: My question is –

A: It’s still."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: It’s still not as good?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: It still doesn’t taste as good.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, even if you’re pate’ing it you still don’t want double
ground?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: No.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: You only want single ground?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Because then you homogenize all the fat.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Is that meat that Marilyn sells – the ground bought meat – is that
ground twice?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: I don’t know.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I don’t buy it, so you’d have to ask her."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, Aajonus – when you pate your meat it never goes through such a
high-powered sort of –

A: No, there’s no pressure – the grinding."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, you can pate it to a sauce and it would be okay?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, you’re going to stop the meat – if you blend the sauce in it
it’s going to arrest because all those things are alkalising – you’re
using the tomato in it – it’s got a high alkalinity, so the bacteria’s not
going to grow in the meat."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What about the meat by itself?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: You will partially digest it – it won’t digest as well by itself.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What about the meat by itself do you think?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: You do that by itself and then when you’re ready to eat it, then you have
your sauce and butter at that time."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Well, what do you do if I’ve already bought already two pounds of ground
beef from her?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Eat it.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Use it and dump the rest.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: I have to eat it then?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, I’d eat it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Why not give it to the poor?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, you can do that pate’d thing with chicken and fish and –

A: Absolutely, you can do it with anything."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: And no sauce is better for digestion – within it – storing it, or
whatever?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yes, you don’t want to store your meat in sauce, unless it’s just for an
hour or two – to marinate it – add flavor."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Did you say butter goes in that sauce?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, yes I did."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I’m putting… and you can even put cheese in it, but the
cheese makes it even hornier if I put that in there."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","The minerals start – they
help my body grow from getting hormones."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Remember, hormones are for emergency
purposes."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, I don’t exercise because I have no activity rings – well,
this is my exercise."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Remember Cary Graham?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",This is his exercise.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","That and sex
– that’s all he used to say for exercise."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Anyway, you can put cheese in it; you can put butter in it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Do not put olive
oil in it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Do not put an oil, or coconut oil."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Put butter in it.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Butter with the white meat, like chicken or turkey, or something like that?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Would that be different – that you could put olive oil in it?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: You don’t really want an oil.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Olive oil is a heavy detoxifier.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: I’ve been putting olive oil in my pate’d chicken for probably six or
seven years."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, well you’ll be constantly detoxifying."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And that’s okay if you like
that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You’re not going to rebuild – not heal very much; olive oil doesn’t
provide for healing."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, just add butter to replace that?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Put butter in your sauce.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Instead of olive oil.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Kathy, do you have a question?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, yeah – that toe of mine is inflamed and swollen – the left one, near
the end."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Uh-huh.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: And I’ve been putting the hot water bottle on at night, but in day time I
have trouble walking – it’s like needles and pins in your foot."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Okay, at night before you go to sleep soak it in lime juice."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Squeeze enough
lime juice."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, you’ve got a little bowl, stick your foot in there –

G: Cold water?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Lime juice.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, just put it in a bowl?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: In a bowl with lime juice in it – yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It’ll be cold – that’s okay
– it doesn’t matter."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: And the filtered water: do I have to use gerolsteiner water?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","What type of
water?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: You’re not using any water – you’re using straight lime juice.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Straight lime juice?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, straight lime juice."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",In a bowl.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, just you use a whole cup – cup
and a ½. You can reuse it – you can reuse it for two months."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Wow.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: So, you just put your foot in it every night for 20 minutes."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Put the hot
water bottle on it for the rest of the night and it will resolve that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Okay?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: And I have to make it with a cup and a ½?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Make a cup of juice – a cup and a ½ of lime juice – in a 12 oz jelly
jar."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, when you finish soaking your foot you can put the juice in the jar and
put it back in the refrigerator."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Next night you take that out put it in the bowl
again, soak your foot for 20 minutes – or that toe in that area."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It’ll be
cold, but that’s fine."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You can warm it if you like; you can put it in a bowl
of warm water and warm it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It’ll work faster if you do that, and you may only
have to soak it for 10 minutes."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Wait a minute – I heat the water on a stove?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, the hot tap water you can."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: But that tap water is fluoride and all that.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: You’re not putting that in the lime juice.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You’re taking the jar
that’s closed with the lime juice in it, right?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You’re immersing that in a
bowl of hot water, so the water’s not getting into the lime juice."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Okay?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, I see."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Do you have a question?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: I’ve got a lot of questions, but one of them is: I think I’ve read up on
your remedies for waking up at night and not being able to get back to sleep –
there’s nut paste; there’s milk and honey; there’s raspberry jam."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","What
else?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Okay, what is your problem?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: I don’t know.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: You go to sleep and you wake up how many hours later?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Two hours – two hours and then I’m awake.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It varies, but I don’t –

A: Stop eating the olive oil."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",You’re detoxing at night-time.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Start eating the butter, start eating more cream."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You’re going to get
fatter again which is good, but you’re going to be able to sleep better."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","As
long as you keep eating the olive oil with your meat you’re going to be in
constant detox."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And that meat’s not going to feed your brain.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And any time you
can’t sleep it’s a protein deficiency, unless you’re on some kind of
cocaine or drug keeping you from sleeping."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: One more thing: can I just say what is that main thing that is hurting my
toe?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",What is that?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Bursa.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What is that?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Bursa: it’s a little sac that makes fluid to lubricate all the toes.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",You’ve got one on each side of the foot.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: But, why now?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Is it detoxing?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Whenever you have a problem, it’s detoxing."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Any time you have a
problem anywhere in the body you’ve got industrial toxins in that area that
need to be removed."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, your body will put extra blood circulation and lymph
circulation into it to feed it and cleanse it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","That causes the swelling, which
causes pain."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If your body can use white blood cells to eat that dead tissue –
see white blood cells in the blood stream eat dead red blood cell tissue."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, the lime is – like, in your juice or in your food – it does – just
antibacterial?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Lime juice will reduce the need for having white blood cells there.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","See,
you’re thinking ahead of me again."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If I wanted to take it out on you –
they’re not as smart as you, okay?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, when we have white blood cells – they
eat dead red blood cells – they keep the blood clean."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Their waste is nutrients
– it can be reused in the body."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It doesn’t even have to dump into the
intestines."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Anything that a white blood cell – as long as it’s organic and
pure and natural – that waste can be recycled in the blood."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Okay?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","When your
body doesn’t have the proper bacteria, parasites or fungus in a particular
area you will get puss."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Puss is white blood cells leaving the blood stream going
into an area to eat up dead cells – dead tissue."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Hmm.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: That’s all it is.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, that’s why your dogs and cats – anytime you’re
pussing – they’ll come over and lick your white blood cells; they know
it’s good stuff because there’s very little toxins in it, but you’re
losing all of these white blood cells."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And remember: you can reproduce your red
and white blood cells in the bone marrow."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It’s a slow process, plus they have
to mature in the bone marrow and when they’re mature they enter the blood
stream."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, it isn’t like they divide and then all of a sudden go into the
blood stream – they have to mature."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, there are only so many red and white
blood cells that can manifest – that can breed in the bone marrow at a time
and mature and get into the system."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, there’s a limit."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, whenever you’re
losing white blood cells with puss it’s a huge waste."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Lime juice coats any
toxin, so your body doesn’t damage cells surrounding cells – so, your body
will have to call in white blood cells to eat them."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, what will happen is:
when the body throws off those toxins through the skin, it will be a little dry
area where you just scratch it off."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, instead of having puss and big area of
the skin which is red and inflamed in puss, you’ll have a little dry area and
you’ll just pick off that toxin as it comes out the dry skin."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Easy way to do
it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Okay?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, if it’s mainly a protein deficiency how come the raspberries and honey
works?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Because they have a tendency to raise sugar levels that pull out glycogen
out of the body."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: But, you can do it with blueberries and honey or some other berries."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I mean,
it doesn’t have to be raspberries?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, it can be any berry."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, that’s just a quick fix – it’s not
going to remedy your problem."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","The problem is you’re having olive oil with your
meat all the time."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Well, with chicken."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: If you do that two days a week – okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Well, not all my meat."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","See, I have at least 50% – sometimes way more –
beef or bison."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And then the chicken which has been –

A: Marinated in olive oil."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Marinated in – well, first with lemon and then the lemon poured off."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And
then a fairly small amount of olive oil and onions or something like that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But,
I could put butter in there – try butter and honey in the –

G: Cream?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: In the food processor.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: The food processor, yeah."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: It would be better because remember the brain uses more white meats than
red."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Eyes use more red meat, the ears use red meat, but the brain itself uses
more white meat."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, if I wanted to be smart like I was as a kid I could eat a lot of red
meat, huh?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, a little bit."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Not with olive oil.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Yeah, okay."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Once in a while – maybe two meat meals a week, out of 14."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Thanks.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: You’re welcome.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Well, first – let’s see."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Well, I don’t really want to do this, but I
will."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Excuse me, I’m going to get upset here."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: It’s okay – be upset.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",It’s a relief.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Really, crying is the best thing
you can do."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It actually transforms toxic hormones – like old toxic adrenaline
and hormones that are man-made poorly out of old toxic stuff from years ago –
and it actually transforms them into endorphins which relax and heal the body."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Great, I’ll feel better after I cry."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: So, just cry all you want to."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I can come back to you in a second."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Okay, so in 2010 I had a hemorrhaging stroke for reasons the doctors can’t
explain to me."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Okay, fine."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, over the last –

A: Let’s resolve that right now: hydrogenated vegetable oils."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Hmm.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Okay, the other thing was: so, for a year and a ½ after that I had great
recovery."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I’d been on the raw diet for a year and during that year I ate a lot
of fish."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And I guess it helped or something.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: But now the fish is contaminated.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, I stopped eating the fish."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Yeah, right around June or July or whatever."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And since then I have lost all my recovery.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Recovery, yeah."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, you’ll just have to go for fish that’s not from the Pacific Ocean
because of the Fukushima radiation."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Need to get it from Nova Scotia or New
England."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Where do you get that?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: You can go to Santa Monica Sea Food Market.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Nova Scotia?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: And New England.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: You said you gave up all sea food.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: All sea food from the Pacific and South Atlantic.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: They don’t have any oysters from Nova Scotia?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, you ask them which ones and they’ll tell you which ones."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Would something like the fermented cod liver oil help at all?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: That would not really heal yourself.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You’ve already had the damage – you
have scar tissue."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: I healed a lot and I recreated a lot of new neurons in the back, then I lost
the ones that I created."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, you just have a block."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",You still have them.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You probably still have the
trans-fatty acids blocking your brain."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Because they collect – they have a
tendency to – like sand and collect."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Oh, she isn’t here this time –
Rosanna: she passed a bunch of little crystals from her urinary tract and she
hit them with a hammer and they wouldn’t even break – they wouldn’t even
dent."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",That’s plastic oil.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",When it is solidified in the body it collects.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I had
one of those pop out of my nose one time."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I mean, I took a sledge hammer –
wouldn’t even dent it – would not even dent it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","That’s the block in your
brain and the only thing that’s going to get rid of that is the Sport Formula,
and hot baths and hot water bottles on your brain – on your head."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: You heat up – I mean, hot water?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Hot water bottles on your head.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Yeah, you wrap it with a towel – he told me."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: The thing is when it comes down to here and then it cuts here – I feel I
can’t move – I feel it hurts me."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, put it a little higher."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, okay."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Can I ask you something about those hot baths? –
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","do you recommend those
hot baths?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Would that be the same as saunas or sweat lodges or –

A: Saunas are a minimum of 132 degrees."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Oh.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Those are the infrared.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And your skin starts being damaged at 110 degrees
– destroy the vitamins and enzymes in your skin."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Imagine what it does to your
sinuses and your bronchial tubes and lungs."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, the hot bath – do you have –

G: There’s two places in his book where he – like, it’s in his book."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, look under Health Modalities – under Baths – it talks about it
there."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, the best thing is to get a hot tub because there’s no varying
temperature – there’s no up and down – and that really works much faster."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: You can’t get that unless you have it – you have to have it some place
to build it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yes, you do."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",If you have an apartment – not possible.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, in terms of what Jan just said: she had some recovery and then she
stopped eating fish and she said she lost some of her apparent recovery."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And why
would she lose the recovery?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: She blocked the same centers that she damaged when she was blocked.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Not that
she’s lost the recovery – it’s blocked again."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: The recovery is blocked in the body?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, the transmission of synapse, and axons and ganglia are blocked again
by the plastic fats."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: So, even though she’s recovered –

G: I haven’t been eating the plastic fats."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I’ve been eating the raw diet.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: They’re in your body and they’re going to be transformed and transported
and moved all the time."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, okay."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: And does fish help unblock the plastic fats?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, it does not – it helps build neurons and nerves, but it does not help
clean it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Vinegar will; pineapple will.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Whoa, whoa, whoa – those will help unblock them?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Those will help unblock.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And heat.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, okay."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Vinegar –

G: Heat – hot baths."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Vinegar, pineapple and heat."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Tomatoes will also help to clear the brain.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Oh.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Do you have a question?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Yes, yes."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",On that thought: tomatoes help clear the brain.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Let’s see: I
have a lot of heavy metals in my brain and over the past years I’ve lost a lot
of memory ability from memory and concentration."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And while I like it a lot for
my artistic sense – because my cognitive brain isn’t interfering with my
creativity – I kind of enjoy that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","However, I need my cognitive centers in my
ability to concentrate and memory."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I’ve been doing the Formula with the berries, and the coconut cream and
whey and milk, and honey, etc."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",that you recommended last time.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I’ve been doing
that – alternating it with the cheese."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Can you comment further?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, the cheese – you just need to – if you want to remove that – she
was a laboratory technician and that had tons of mercury and formaldehyde –

G: No, scientist."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Scientist.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Scientist, sorry."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Thank you.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Scientist, I’m sorry."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: I degraded her.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Demotion.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And she got a lot of mercury and formaldehyde in
her system – inhaling it in through her skin, everything."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","She’s full of
metals – she could be the female terminator."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Now, that takes a while to get
rid of them: it takes 50 to 200 fat molecules to get rid of one molecule of
mercury, safely."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, it’s going to be a long haul."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, if that part of your
brain is stuck – it’s not really dead because I didn’t see a lot of death
in the brain."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Yours is clogged too with the trans-fatty acids.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You just have to
clear that the same way."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Cognitive factors – that’s the right side, so you
put it on the right side of your head."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Alright.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So: vinegar, pineapple, heat, tomatoes?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: The hot baths and the Metal Detox Formula that you recommended?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Right, and cheese."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: And cheese?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Okay, thanks."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: You’re welcome.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Is the Metal Detector Formula – is that the Vaccine Formula?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, no."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",It’s berries and coconut cream and dairy.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And vinegar – if you
add vinegar to it, it absorbs faster."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, the problem with the vinegar and the
berries and coconut cream and all that – it tastes so good people start
chugging it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And then sometimes they get stomach aches because they drink it too
fast."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, that’s why I don’t tell a lot of people vinegar."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, if you have
control, add vinegar; if you don’t have control, don’t have the vinegar."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Okay?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",You should only have a tsp.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",of vinegar.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Last question: cream for the brain – should I be eating more cream?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Should
I emphasize the cream in my diet?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: If you want to rebuild it.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",If it’s clogged you’ve got to unclog it.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: I think your brain is good.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: I don’t think you’re having the problem there.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You’re having the
blocks."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Your ganglia and axons are getting full of these plastic bottles of crystals
and then the synapse can’t fire."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, hot water bottle on the right side."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If
you want, you can put one up here and one up here."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Then put a towel over it so
you can breathe – leave your nose and mouth out, unless you get a snorkel."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Was
anybody here at the last potluck – we had Jon and Jill from Nevada City?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You
know how they get in their hot tubs?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, the snorkel."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Snorkel.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Put a snorkel.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Can you imagine – all these years I’ve never thought of
that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I could get my whole head under my hot tub all those years and have the
snorkel."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: But, it’s a rubber mouth piece – right?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, as long as they’re cured – that’s okay."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Rubber’s okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If
it’s plastic – and the heat – could be a problem."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, rubber’s okay."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Wow, that’s cool."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, it is."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I never thought about that.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Everything’s under – they’ve got the snorkel.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Wow.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: They would do that in the bath tub?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Well, where do they get the snorkel?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Sporting goods store.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: And how long do they stay in the entire session, under the –

A: I didn’t ask that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: I wonder how long they can be under like that?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: The conversations are very interesting.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, in my hot tub – it was a Greek tub – big tub – 10 feet in
diameter – and then I had an area to sit on here and then the open pit to
here."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I would have my feet sat over this side and my head on this side and
my body wouldn’t be touching anything in between."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And I would sleep that way.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, my head was always this much under water."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","The thing with the snorkel you
could get your whole body under water."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And just fill the hot tub with a little
bit more."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",It would have been great.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Do you have a question?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Yeah, if you eat something that’s not organic – if you eat lots of fat
with it – lots of butter or cream – will that absorb –

A: Some of it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Not all of it?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Not all of it.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Now, there were some laboratory tests that came in about
three months ago that showed that organic food had five times more pesticides
and garbage on it than non-organic food."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: How could that be?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: That means that people are – like the Bush’s – like who bought and own the
Whole Foods Trust and the Bush family from Texas – they are propagandizing; they
are poisoning you purposely."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","They’re going out finding the worst foods, saying
they are organic to destroy those people who have intelligent minds."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Remember,
when Bush was involved: Nicaragua, El Salvador and in Cambodia – what did they
do?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","They went around and killed all the professor - anybody who had intelligence
who could think."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",They got rid of the thinking class.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Now, if you go in to
Cambodia you’ve got a bunch of cowboys who don’t have wisdom – there’s not many
old people there who knew anything."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And it’s a really weird country.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You’ve got
kids with no sense of wisdom running a country."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Hmm.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Anything the American Government wants – the CIA – they’ll do anything
that they want, which means in corporate hands."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, they’re dumbing you down."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",You people who know about organic – they’re dumbing you down.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I don’t
trust any organic food from Whole Foods."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Only thing that I will ever buy from
Whole Foods is Gerolsteiner or San Pelegrino water, or their all-grass-fed beef."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Because when I taste it, it is all-grass-fed; you can’t have anything that
tastes likes venison except for all-grass-fed beef."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: The cucumbers are okay because it’s not waxed.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I bought the cucumber
there."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Like I said: I don’t trust anything from them.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I would go to Erewhon
first; I would go to Santa Monica Co-Op; I would go to Rainbow Acres."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I stay
away from Whole Foods."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What about Sprouts?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Sprouts?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: They’re usually grown in whatever city’s water’s used – they’re
not grown in pure water."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, you’ve got fluoride, you’ve got – if
they’re grown in LA they’re using 192 chemicals in our water."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: He means the store Sprouts.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: There’s a store chain called Sprouts.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: See, there’s a chain of stores, similar to Whole Foods, called Sprouts."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Oh, those are okay."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","When they get bought up by Whole Foods then they won’t
be any good."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: But, they’re not okay."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: I know – so, they’re okay."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, now that their produce in Whole Foods – I shouldn’t go –

A: I don’t trust anything from Whole Foods."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I won’t shop at a Whole Foods,
except for that meat and that water."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Are you okay with the New Zealand lamb if it’s in the original package?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, I called into New Zealand about the lamb and it’s okay."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Good.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What about the Icelandic lamb?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Pardon?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Icelandic’s – they actually have lamb in Iceland.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Really?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I haven’t called about that, so – I would check everything –
absolutely everything."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And then their whole natural beef?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",They feed it 25% donuts – bakery waste.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","When they first came out – when I talked with their offices in Texas – I got
to the man who handles that – you know they don’t grow all that – they
contract with ranchers, just like I contract with farmers to get our milk."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, a
Whole Foods contracts with ranchers to provide certain kinds of meats grown and
provided for in the way that they want it done."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And to cut costs, they buy this
very inexpensive bakery waste, which are donuts."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And they were feeding it - at
that time when they first opened, 15% bakery waste – now it’s 25% bakery
waste."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And I said: “Wait a minute, cows don’t eat donuts – fry them in
trans-fatty acids.” “"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Oh, but they eat the grains.”"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Should I throw away the cucumbers then I bought from them?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: That’s up to you.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: How about Trader Joe’s?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I have some organic Trader Joe’s.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Trader Joe’s – that’s a tough one too – that’s a very tough one.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",They cut a lot of corners to get the foods.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And they lie – I’ve caught them
lying quite a few times."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, you can’t really tell whether they’re true or
not."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, basically we don’t know what to eat?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, that’s why I say: you’ve got to know your farmer – we’ve got
to make more contracts with more farmers."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","That’s why I’ve put all these
farmers together."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","That’s why I’m spending thousands and thousands of dollars
fighting the government for farmers."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Farmers?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Is this the Farmers Market [in Los Angeles] – is this what
we’re talking about?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, those guys are garbage."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Any Amish in California?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Amish farmers?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Too expensive – land is too expensive here.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",They’d go broke.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","There are a
lot in Kansas – Kansas is the next place I’m going to, to recruit."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: For bringing our produce in?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Everything.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Like I said: we don’t eat much produce, so I don’t worry
about that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: I mean for celery, or lettuce."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, like I say: go to these other ones – you go to Erewhon."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Erewhon, yeah."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: I know the people – I’ve known the people at Erewhon for 32 years.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: There’s new owners there now.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, they’ve sold it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",But Teddy’s still there and Alan’s still there.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, okay."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: And I’ve known them for 32 years.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Hey, Aajonus – you said that the fat will absorb some."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Now some – do you
mean ¼, ½, ¾?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Depends on how much concentrated the poisons are.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You’ve got five times
the pesticides that’s normal that are in commercial."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","In your organic you could
even eat probably five tbsp."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","butter with a ½ pint of berries and not clear it
all."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",You have cheese with it you’re likely to clear it all.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, really?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Oh.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Cheese and butter; cheese and cream.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, that would be good for an emergency?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Let’s say you couldn’t get
grass-fed and you had to shop at Ralphs’."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, you could have cheese and butter
with that meat?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, but you have to understand that those toxins that cause mutant genes
in that meat... So, not the best thing in the world."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Like I say: you need to cut
meat up and store it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Louis has started to make a storage of meats.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","What you do
is cut them up."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I dry them for 30 minutes on each side.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","That’s four sides in
the sun – 30 minutes on each side just to seal the blood in."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And then I coat
it with olive oil, and then stick it in a quart jar or a ½ gallon jar, with
maybe a cup-cup ½ olive oil."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I stuff the meat down in there tightly and then of
course the olive oil will go up to a certain point, then I’m going to stuff
more meat in, I’ll put more olive oil."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I’ve got this much olive oil
covering the top of the meat and then still this much air-space – about ½
inch to ¾ of an inch because it’s going to out-gas a little bit."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And when you
see the top bending, bowing you let that gas out and put it back on."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And usually
you’ll only have to do that two times."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I kept meat that way for 10 years.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And I had 10 of them that I made.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And each
year I took out – it was for the Y2K. I was a programmer so I knew the Y2K was
just a money scam."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Crashing computers – no, it would just make a lot of your
figures bad as it changes dates."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, it’s not going to destroy anything –
it’s not going to create a bad catastrophe."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, these programmers made
billions of dollars putting – what was the guy that ran from Texas?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Perot?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Perot.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Perot.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Yeah, he made billions off of that because he had programming
systems. “"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Oh, we’ll save you.”"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, he charges 10 times more than normal
because we got a disaster coming."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, they made a bunch."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Anyway, I made these jars and took out one a year later to see how it tastes
and they were wonderful."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: You stored them where?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: I stored them in low a cupboard – non-refrigeration.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What temperature?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: The room: I didn’t use heat and I was in Malibu mountains near the top, so
at the warmest it probably got was 98 degrees in the day-time and the coldest it
got was probably 30 degrees, 35, 36."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: It was just red meat, or all kinds of meat?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: It was just red meat.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",It was all venison – it was a deer.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: I find that when I pate the meat and I really stuff it in those Ball jars
with no air in it, it just stays – but, I am putting it in the refrigerator
– it’s staying pink."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Is that something similar to what you’re describing?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, that’s an entirely different way of keeping it, but you still have to
keep it refrigerated."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: I do keep mine like that when I pate it – I keep it refrigerated.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But,
when you’re storing a lot more for emergency purposes you’re not going to
have a refrigerator when the electricity goes out."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, you need something
that’s going to store meat without refrigeration."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Can you pate it and then just cover that with a thin layer of olive oil?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, no, we’re not putting it in the refrigerator."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","We’re making my pate
for the week."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: No, I’m just saying that as an alternative to the one you said."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I’m
saying, could you also pate it –

A: I don’t know –

G: And then try it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: You’d have to try it –.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: And see.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I haven’t tried it.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What do you coat it with?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",What do you have – one of those brushes?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, a basting brush."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Oh.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",What is it made of?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Not nylon?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, they have some that are made out of boars bristle."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I don’t know if
you can still get them."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I had one that was made out of that.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You can get more
bristles: you can get those vegetable scrubs and just rub it all around."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: How long will you let it sit out in the sun?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: 30 minutes on each side.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, you’ve got four sides – that’s two hours."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, you have to flip them every 30 minutes."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: It’s not as aggressive – you’re talking about?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It’s a white bristle
you’re washing your meat with?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: What do you mean?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: It’s like a vegetable brush you’re talking about.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, I was giving two alternatives: I was talking about vegetable brush or
the brush."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You could also go in to a paint store – an artist’s paint store
– and find a natural bristle larger brush."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Very expensive – may cost you 30,
50 dollars – but then you know it’s natural."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And you keep that for –

G: Oh, yeah."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Olive oil won’t break it down.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I’ve had brushes that are 36-years-old
that are fine paint brushes when I used to paint and they’re still good."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You
know, I always clean mine with olive oil."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Do you know where an artist’s shop is around?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: There’s Michaels in Santa Monica.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, Michaels – okay."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Do you have a question?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Yeah, I’ve been experiencing more than normal for me diarrhea, nausea,
bloating."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Just lack of appetite, and for me that’s not normal."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Intestinal detox.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese – absorb all that
stuff."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Remember, when you have gas and you have swelling like that, that means
your poisons are mixing with your digestive juices."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Cheese will absorb those –

G: With honey?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: So they don’t mix.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Without honey?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: No.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Remember, when you’re detoxing cheese is not to be digested; it’s to
absorb the poisons and move out."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, if you’re using raw no-salt raw cheese
you won’t digest it – there’s no enzymes in it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, the body will use it
to absorb those toxins and move out the bowels."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If you eat honey with it
that’s to digest the cheese."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You don’t want to digest your poisons –
re-digest your poisons."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, when I tell you to have cheese for detoxification
it’s without fruit or honey."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: With that volume of cheese that you’ve been talking about for a couple of
hours here – I’ve tried eating cheese with butter, and it doesn’t seem to
do anything – cheese just creates a kind of –

A: Jim, you were one of the most fat-deficient persons I’ve ever met."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It’s
going to take you another 10 years to catch up on getting the fats that – the
butter in your system – the fats that you need."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, just more butter – more butter with cheese?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: More butter – more butter you need in your diet.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: And you may need honey and butter together to digest it all.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It depends on
how well your liver’s working – producing enough bile."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Bile is produced by
the liver – that’s the only thing the liver is supposed to do."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Bile
fractionates fat globules – spreads it out so the bacteria can infiltrate it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Without the bile, fat molecules cluster into balls."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: As far as cheese: you mentioned to me 30 minutes after a meat meal to eat a
couple tbsp."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",cheese with some honey.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","That seemed to be an exception to –

A: No, let’s go over this again: after you have the meat meal, 20 minutes
after that you have a little piece of cheese – maybe one or two cubes, to
absorb the poisons."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",10 minutes after that you have the cheese and honey.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, ah."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Just remember, I always say: 10 minutes before you eat anything you eat a
piece of cheese, so you’re not getting the poisons into your food – it’ll
be absorbed into that cheese first."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And that includes the cheese with the honey.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You have the cheese 10 minutes before that – plain cheese – or cheese with
butter 10 minutes before you have the honey and cheese."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Okay?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Question, Michael?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: I’ve had a rash on my legs for a long time – it’s getting a little bit
worse."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I use egg white, butter and bone marrow."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","The egg whites treat it
(Inaudible), the butter and the bone marrows for the itching that it causes."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It
lets me sleep at sleep, but it’s been two years now."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: You just have to remember that you’ve got toxins coming out that skin
constantly – either from your joints or form the bone itself – discharging
out of that place."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Now, I will experiment with some of my advanced cancer patients when they come
to me."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I had this one woman who had the same thing like that, but around her
breast."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",It was half-gone.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Now, I saw it yesterday and it was starting to grow
back and the actual breast – first time I’ve seen a breast starting to grow
back that was already collapsing from the body breaking down the cancers in
there and dissolving it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I told her I’m used to people losing a breast
naturally – so, they don’t lose all their lymphatic glands around them and
it keeps them from having lung cancer."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, her breast actually started growing
back."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, what started it was: I told her to start packing it with cheese."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Huh.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Taking a little cheese and milk and mashing it, getting it into a paste and
put the cheese over it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Stopped all of the bleeding, stopped all that – the
deterioration and started a healing effect."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, that doesn’t mean that she
doesn’t have trouble later because she still has to get rid of the dead cells
that make up the tumor."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",She still has some hardened tumor over here.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","All the
tumor up here is all gone – it’s just soft and breast again."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Now, there’s
just a little bit down here."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, she stopped it from secreting."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Now, it may go
inside her or grow down this way – the cancer movement."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And I warned her that
that might happen."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, she just panicked."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, this was just a quick fix so she wouldn’t run to the doctor and have her
whole breast cut off and all her lymph glands and all of that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","She was on the
diet about six years."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Hmm.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: And that breast and the tumor should have been absolute gargantuan,
according to the medical profession, but each year it’s been getting softer
and smaller."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, she’s been (Inaudible)."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, when it’s been leaking and
bleeding a lot – and that’s a sign that the cancer cells are actually dying
– they contain like a solvent product that dissolves the dead cells – you
only have one cancer cell around 50 to 200 dead cells – it’s isolated."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But,
you do have blood and lymph and neurological circulation in a malignant tumor."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Not in a benign tumor – no circulation in a benign tumor.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It’s a dead
substance – you’re not going to eliminate it easily."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, when you have all
the circulations into it you can dissolve a tumor – you can restore the body
to a working, functional, living system again."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","When you have a benign tumor and
stop living the whole area is completely dead."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, when that cancer cells begins
dying and sending out that solvent to dissolve all those dead cells the serum
has got to go somewhere."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You don’t want it to go inside – you want it to
come out, through of the skin."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And it’s going to damage skin – it’s going
to buckle it, it’s going to cause it to be sore and other things – but, you
will discharge it that way."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, I was very happy with the process."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, I let
her know that, that was a quick fix."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If it seeps again, enjoy the seep –
that’s the cancer cells dissolving all those dead cells that make up 90% of
the tumor."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: There are people that just leave it alone.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Hold on.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",He raised his hand first – go ahead.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, I used to have lower back pain on the left side and it was from
straining the back and then it would go away, or I would have it adjusted and it
would be fine."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","About two months ago I got it on the right side lower back and
almost immediately started to get numbness, only down the back of my leg."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Sciatica.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Hot water bottle.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Okay, hot water bottle to this area."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Now, the back irritation is gone but
I’ve gotten severe nerve (Inaudible) when I stand up and so forth right now."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Then you’ve got a block – you have trans-fatty acids or mineral blocking
that system."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Okay, so the hot water –

A: Vinegar and pineapple and beet –

G: Would the hot baths help?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, does it feel deep or surface?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Umm, no – more deep."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Then, it’s got to be internal."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Let’s keep on the subject that we were talking about.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: How do you know that Mike doesn’t have shingles?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, shingles is always toxins leaving through the skin – drying out the
skin."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Couldn’t that be what’s happening with him?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, that’s what I said."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, I see."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Well, let me tell you with shingles: I had a patch – just
almost a square patch – itching."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And I went in the book and I looked, and I
found shingles and I had a banana and honey – just like you said."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And poof –
the thing went away."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Just amazing.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: You mean you ate a banana or rubbed it?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: I ate a banana – I mean I loaded it with honey and it was like – a great
aid."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: What a great cure.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, well what that did was that created a mucosal coating on the cells to
protect them as the toxins came through."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If people do it too often it’ll send
the poisons somewhere else."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, you’ll find you get shingles somewhere else or
dry skin somewhere else."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Well, I did have one other one, so I had another banana and more honey and
that one went away."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And that was it.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, so, it balances out – detox it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: I can definitely (Inaudible) the honey liberally now.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: There’s a bag right down there next to you – can you hand it to me?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","That
one – yeah, that one."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: I was just going to ask you something about what the cancer – that if
people just leave it alone won’t it just go away?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And it just won’t bother
you, but it’s the medical tradition that’s been effecting the cancer."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: It doesn’t go away.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: According Hardin B. Jones 76% of the cancer that he observed went away on
its own."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: See.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: But, the other 24% didn’t."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",That was in the 50’s and the 60’s.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Straight from the cow – unrefrigerated.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Where did you get it?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Did you get it when you were in Cincinnati?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, I’ve got a guy."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","In his retirement he became a farmer – that’s now
retirement."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I got it right from him – his cow."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",In Ohio.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Ohio, oh."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Wow.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: It’s a lot of fat in that one – you can see it.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: It’s creamy.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: He has Jersey cows?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, all Jersey."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: I have a question.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, a question here – she hasn’t had a question."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Oh, and these two haven’t – yeah."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Teeth – I had a tooth pulled here because it was cracked and I didn’t
want a root canal."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",It was just a few weeks ago.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Still, I get a tiny bit of pink
saliva in the morning."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Is that okay?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, you probably have a little bit of old chip in there."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: What was the question, excuse me?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, okay."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Teeth – oh, she said she had a tooth pulled because it cracked and she
didn’t want a root canal to put a crown on it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, she had a –

G: It had an abscess."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, abscess is just a nerve playing out around the tooth – not the tooth
itself."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Anyway, and she said she keeps having in the morning a little bit of pink
seepage, which means she has some little splinter of bone of tooth still in
there."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I had the same thing last year – I had a tooth that came loose back
here and I had a root canal done on it – probably 1978."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And of course the Navy
Dentist wanted to pull any teeth that’s got a root canal."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Root canals are not
bad – it’s the poisons that go in."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Especially the injections that they give
– xylocaine and novocaine."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","They create a tremendous amount of tongue and jaw
cancer, facial cancer, eye cancer, brain cancer."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, they will now hook you into
this crap, believing that root canals are not good."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","When a root canal is done
there’s no nerve ending, so your body is not going to be dumping any toxins
into that tooth."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, the whole idea that you’re going to have a toxic tooth
because you have a root canal is absurd."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You may get an abscess around it, but
that’s the nerve from the brain going down to the tooth base still cleaning."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Only it’s not cleaning through the tooth anymore, it’s cleaning out the gum
and around the gum – so you get abscesses."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Anyway, I got an abscess because this tooth was ready to be removed."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It was in
my way because I was constantly chewing – getting all in there and it hurt."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, I just took some dental floss and rapped it around it – yanked it out."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",That took care of it.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Do it yourself.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: But, I had a bone fragment that came – passed out in the next six months
and I could feel it poking and my body just worked its way out to the point
where I could popped it out."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And it was a good – probably – three 36th of an
inch long and about a 37th of an inch thick."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: You could have a bone graft done – that’s not good?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, it isn’t good – you have to trust your body to rebuild your own
bone."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Oh.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Like my bone when I pulled out that tooth – because I’d just tapped that
in there – I wasn’t going to pull it until I had to – the bone was gone
way down."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Now it’s grown all the way up again.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, should I have him remove it – or leave it?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Your body may have a chip that it’s trying to throw out.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Okay, I got it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, is there anything I should have him do – or just leave it?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Just let it go because they’ll just shoot you with more novocaine.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Not good.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Then I have a tooth here that is dead, so now it has the (Inaudible)."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Okay, that’s not the tooth – that’s the nerve leaking."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: He said it’s eating away my bone and my sinus is a mess.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: It will eat away the bone because it needs calcium, but you can grow it
back."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, just leave this tooth?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Leave it – absolutely.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: I’ve got four dead teeth in my mouth and I’m not removing them until my
body says: “You’re coming out.”"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, should we try this at home?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, certainly."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: You’ll get calls in the middle of the night.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: I’ve found even those pliers useful at least for small teeth.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: The Three Stooges have a documentary about this…

G: Can I ask a question about this tooth?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, this is a veneer."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Uh-huh.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: And I really want it to stay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","He’s a biological dentist – he says
there’s a root canal that almost never gets infected because it’s made from
something called MTA – it really cleans it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And this is what he wants to do
– to take this infection off - because he says I’m not going to feel it
going up here."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It’s like my whole head is sometimes –

A: But, that’s your nerve detoxing – it’s not the tooth."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: The infection that’s going in my sinus?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, that’s from the brain because you’ve got mercury or something in
that nerve going down to the tooth."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Right.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: The nerve’s detoxing – you’re not backing up the tooth this way.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If a
tooth detoxes it’s going to come out the gum."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: It’s been this way for eight years.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, just keep the tooth and not worry about – there’s a lot of stuff
that goes on in here – like here, down here –

A: But, that’s all your nerves cleaning out the toxicity from the brain."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: So, just keep the tooth – right?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I could’ve kept this one too.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, absolutely."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Novocaine.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Novocaine is terrible stuff.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: I’ll ask a second question.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, these two have two and then we’re going to be finished."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, okay."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: You’ll have to call me on any other questions.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Go ahead.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Four years I’ve been eating this kind of food.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I ride my bike for almost
five years – almost every day."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I don’t use a car to work.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I go everywhere
– Pasadena – any place."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, I want to gain weight, but they say: “Oh,
because you’re used to your bicycle.”"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, like I told him: you have to eat two pounds of meat a day – one pound
at a time – with the lubrication formula."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A whole lubrication formula,
that’s on page 146 of the Recipe Book."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",You make two of those a day.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You have
to eat one of those with each meal and you will gain the weight."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Everybody has
– all my skinny little people like you become big and strong like him."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Now, it depends on the height of the person."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: One pound twice daily – so, two pounds a day."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Two pounds a day.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Two pounds a day?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It’ll take you – it depends on how much you work out and how
quickly you will build the muscle."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, I’ve seen it happen in five months."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Like I said: Lucky put four inches on his arms and six inches on his chest in
five months."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Wow.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: And do you eat it with the meat or after?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",You wait a little while?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, you eat a 1/3 of it with the meat and then the rest 10 minutes after."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","You eat a 1/3 of the Lubrication Formula with the meat and then 2/3’s of it
about 10 minutes after you finish the meat meal."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Can I ask another question?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",My friend called me last night.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",He paralyzed his face.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Stroke.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: The eyes are like that and the mouth like that.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, I say in the book."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, also she needs vinegar."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It is also helpful to
clean the system out because if you have a stroke you either have a bleeding of
the brain, so the brain doesn’t get nutrients and it fills up and swells in
the brain – that usually causes death."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, if she isn’t dead then what she
had was a block in her brain."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And depending what the block was - was it mineral
block-up or trans-fatty acids - either way, vinegar will help remove that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: And bottles of water?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Oh, hot water bottle – absolutely."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Always hot water bottles on an injury
and pain."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Thank you.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Yeah, so I’ve been doing the diet for about seven years and the raw meat
I’ve apparently not doing right – I know now I should pate – I’m going
to do that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","But, I’ve always added honey to it – it sounds really that’s
not necessary?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",You don’t like adding honey to the meat.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, it just adds enzymes from breaking it down."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","If you pate it, you
don’t need the honey with it."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, okay."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: And it’s better.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Honey has a tendency to add certain bacteria.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And then can I get that sauce one more time that you gave?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It’s so
good because I’m getting so tired of the meat."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And I love the sauce.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, I have 82 sauces in the Recipe Book."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: The one that you said is so good.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Can you give it one more time?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: It’s two and a ½ cups tomato; I put two to three eggs, depending on the
size of the eggs; two cloves of garlic; one slice of onion that’s about an
1/8th or three thirty-seconds of an inch thick; one – those packages of dill
– at least one –

G: Solid box."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: A little plastic box.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And not the stalks, but the stems and the tentacles."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And one and a ½ tbsp.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",vinegar.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",You can have up to two.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Like anybody that’s had a stroke or anything
like that, probably two would be better."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Or any kind of clogs or blockages in
blood-flow or whatever – varicose veins – spider veins."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","And put about two
tbsp."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",of butter – a heaping heaping tbsp.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",of butter.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","So, it would be three
tbsp."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",of butter.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And cheese if you like.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: You said honey too before?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, two tbsp."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",of honey.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: And that’s put in the quart jar and then blended with the Osterizer
blender?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Yeah, and I do that for a full 50 seconds to a minute – a full 60 seconds."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: How long did you make it last for?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: I’ve had it last for months.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Without refrigeration?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Well, both with and without."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","I made a big batch – I took off to
Philippines and left some in the refrigeration, took some with me, ate it
without refrigeration when I went to this last 10-day trip to Chicago and
Cincinnati."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",I couldn’t refrigerate it at all – I left it out the whole time.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: But, you said the eggs go bad in 24 hours."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Not in this.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","It’s such a little part – you’ve got the vinegar and
honey to stop them from advancing."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: Wow.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: But, you just eat the meat and leave it in the sauce?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, I pate my meat and spread that on the top."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, you just spread it on the top?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: And I put my butter on the side and I take a little butter with a big chunk
of meat."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Well, how much butter?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: I said two to three tbsp.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: I’m sorry, the cheese with honey."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Two tbsp.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","of honey –

G: Yes."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Whatever cheese you want.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: How much cheese?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Whatever.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: It’s optional.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: Use inch-cube; two-inch cube – it depends on what consistency you like.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",And if you want a really tart sauce then don’t put so much cheese in it.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: And if you don’t fill it all the way to the top then I’ve left something
out, right?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","Or, I’m not adding enough of something because it should fill all
the way to the top."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, it doesn’t have to."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, it doesn’t?"
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: Depending on the size of tomatoes and stuff; depending on the size of the
eggs."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",Mine was probably three or four oz below the quart level.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: You don’t worry about oxygenation with that?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","A: No, because I use hard whey and it sits there in the refrigeration for
months."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",G: And you’ve blended it too.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: It seems to last great.
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: I’ve aired it, so I don’t have to worry about that."
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt",A: What time is it folks?
"Q&A_Of_October_14,_2012.txt","G: Oh, it’s time – it’s 5:35."

Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Aajonus Vonderplanitz was without question an extremely controversial activist in the fields of
nutrition and health."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"The way he presented himself to the public eye (Ripleys or the Doctors) may not have created a lot of
confidence however the many people whom he reached through his books, Primal Diet newsletters,
Q&A sessions, Primal Diet Workshops, interviews and consults saw the real Aajonus – an extremely
caring and competent person."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"He did not make a big point of the years he spent researching before his books came out, but did
occasionally mention details in Q&A sessions in private homes, to people he knew."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Then after his
books came out he continued to research and do private consults, constantly gathering data."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"When he
found a better way to accomplish something (such as a more effective remedy or faster road to
recovery) he was generally quite pleased."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"He would mention these in Q&As, Primal Diet Workshops or
private consultations."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"It was up to a small group of enthusiasts to somehow get Aajonus’s amazing findings and remedies out
to those interested all over the world."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"That was and is the purpose of the WeWant2Live.com website
and it is the purpose behind any compilations or recordings being distributed through that website."

“I got on my bicycle and went around to the farms."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Around there was a farming
community."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"I made deals to shovel manure, to milk goats and cows, slaughter - to do
whatever I had to do on the farms in exchange for food."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"And all I wanted was chickens,
beef (unfrozen), butter, cheese, all the dairy I could consume and eggs."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"That is what I
lived on - nothing but that - for 2 1/2 months."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,I gained 55 pounds.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"For the first time in my
life, I was able to do physical work and enjoy it! ..."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,with literally no pain!
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So, I was ecstatic."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,...I can feel alive!
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,I do feel alive!’
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,“And it is the first time in my life that I have ever felt this way.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,I was very happy.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"And I
continued eating that way but only 3 days a week that I ate raw meat and sustained on
raw dairy and eggs."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"And then I got better and better and got to the point where I could
run up to 13 miles a day. ..."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"For the first time in my life, I got athletic."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"But then, after about
a year, I thought 'why am I doing this - because I could!’"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"But then I had no interest in
spending my time running around."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"My brain seemed to be doing better than my body so
I like to think a lot, read a lot, learn a lot and experiment - and do projects.”"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"June 22, 2013

I'm just so happy because I thought it would take 40 years to get your body back into a
state with the greatest amount of health -- minus that you couldn't get rid of because of
vaccines because of too many poisons too much mercury too much fat needed to
remove them."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It's not that way with the cheese.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"It's spectacular and of course eating in
this pattern helps."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Other people who’ve done the cheese - and it works very well - but eat
their own food pattern and it doesn't work as well and they don't get as strong so they
don't move as quickly in every which way."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"June 22, 2013

...when I checked the fecal matter, I found a lot of toxins embedded in this dried matter
that was coming out. ..."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"a lot of constipation but high ratios of toxins in that dried food
and I said ‘How about cheese! ..."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"let’s try cheese; high minerals, dehydrated, can’t digest it
unless it’s cooked or with salt, that fractionates it so you can re-digest the cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So, it
has to be no-salt raw cheese so it goes through the system and collects poisons."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So
about three years ago, a little longer than three, I got a lot of people to do it."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Before, I had
a few people doing it."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"But 3 years ago I started doing it because the success was so great
with 50 people, I tried it with probably 200 people."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"I said ‘When you get up in the
morning, you eat a tablespoon or 2 tablespoons."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If you are a guy this big, you eat three
tablespoons of cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"First thing in the morning absorb all the poisons that have

dumped into the stomach and intestines."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It will go through like a train and just pick it up.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,And it does!
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Then after then, suck some eggs; get the brain fuel going."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"June 22, 2013

Somebody got in my house and poisoned my milk. ....."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"And I started eating cheese to
absorb it and collect it."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"And I noticed that it worked very very well, because it cut down on
my nausea 90%."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"That was about six years ago, so now I ask other people that I was
seeing frequently, once a year to me is frequent."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Because you know I don't need to see
people very often on this diet, they get well so I don't need to see them frequently."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So I
decided to ask other people to eat different amounts of cheese and all day long."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"And
those that ate it once an hour did very very well, those who ate it every 45 minutes did
even better, those that did every 30 minutes did even better, 20 minutes, 15 minutes,
and the results were incredible."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Even again, I just went to three cities, St Louis and
Stockton, Missouri, and Omaha and everybody who has diligently done the cheese every
20 to 30 minutes, the amount of detoxification is sped up like 2 to 6 years in 1 year, I
mean it's astounding."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So thank God the people who can't take the hot tubs or you know,
aren't taking enough baths, at least I can get them to side track them going out the skin
and going into the intestinal tract to remove it."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"June 16, 2013

Since I’ve had people doing it [ lymphatic bath ] at least five days a week, 90 minutes a day,
plus eating the cheese every day – anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes daily – the increase
in lymphatic activity and cleansing and healing has tripled."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"May 27, 2012 -

I've seen in people who were diligent who were eating cheese every 15 minutes, and I
had one fellow whose entire intestinal tract was black and I thought this guy is going to
take a long time to get well."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,And he was on his way out.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"He was very skinny, and I saw
him a year later and his digestive tract had cleaned by two thirds."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"He got the mercury
out of it from the cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"June 16, 2013

“Two factors cause the rampant, modern progression of afflictions such as cancer,
diabetes, osteoporosis, obesity, heart disease, chronic fatigue syndrome and
fibromyalgia."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"“The first factor is eating cooked and/or processed food that is devoid of live nutrients
and full of the toxic byproducts of cooking, pesticides and other chemicals."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If you are
interested in the names and research on those toxins, purchase and read The Recipe For
Living Without Disease."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,“The second factor is environmental pollution.

have created over 6,000 bizarre foreign chemicals that our bodies have not succeeded in
processing as food or air."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Toxic accumulations within our bodies cause more
deterioration."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Some chemicals cause immediate death, but most cause the gradual
degeneration that leads to poor-quality health."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Article: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"... any kind of raw cheese or even a cottage cheese
It does not matter."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Cottage cheese ok?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Cottage is fine – as long as it’s not too wet.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Not too wet.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Yeah.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Does it have to be unsalted?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It has to be unsalted.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Salt is an explosive – it starts fractionating your food, so if you have
raw salted cheese you’re going to reabsorb your poisons."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If you have pasteurized cheese
you’re going to reabsorb your poisons."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If you have salted pasteurized cheese you’re going
to really not synthesize, as well as reabsorbing your poisons – toxins."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"October 14, 2012

The reason that I say don't add salt to cheeses is because when it goes into the body, it
starts breaking up the cheese and then causing your body to digest it."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"The problem: what
happens to you in the blood is that if you have salt in there of course your body will take
the sodium chloride, or the sodium potassium or however you're getting the sodium, and
separate it."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It will isolate because it’s in rock form.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"We don't eat we rock, plants eat rock."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"June 22, 2013

Does cottage cheese work the same?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Yes.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Cottage cheese is still dehydrated, although not as much as hard cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If you want to get your minerals with cottage cheese, do you still take it with honey?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Yes, with honey."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"September 26, 2010

Does it matter if it's the soft cheese or the hard cheese?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If it is cottage cheese, you need to let it dry more than you get it from the farmer."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"It is a
little too soft."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Just remember, any soft cheese has a certain amount of enzymes in it."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"You
do not want to digest the cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"You want the cheese to absorb poisons and get it out
of the body."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"June 16, 2013

How about feta, raw goat feta, is that good, or is that too salty?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It's too salty.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Salt for you is absolute poison.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"May 6, 2000

What about moldy cheese?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Moldy cheese I scrape the...the outer white layer off because that has all the spores in it
and you can get to much mycelium generating in your system and you can get very
lethargic."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So, no moldy cheese?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Yes, you can eat moldy cheese; just scrape the white top off."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"September 9, 2007

Spores on cheese
Cheese, though, grows white spores off the top."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"The spores are aerobically incited like
tiny microscopic mushrooms that let out all these spores for mycelium."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Mycelium is like
the mother... like salmonella on the body."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"It goes into the ground and eats dead roots –
whether grass or trees, whatever."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"In the woods the milky substance oozing all over a
dead felled tree is mycelium."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"When the mycelium is finished working, it will grow
mushrooms whose spores will find dead roots and take effect there."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Mycelium will grow;
you’ll have this milky substance in the ground eating and decomposing the roots which
become nutrients for other plants."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"When you eat that even from a cheese, it can incite
heavy detoxification (decomposition) of any part of network in the body that’s dead –
neurological, blood stream, lymphatic branches. ["
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"That is a ] good thing but can
sometimes be very debilitating."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"It is OK to eat the mycelium mold on the inside of the
cheese but when you eat the spores, it can go rampant so just scrape them off on the
outside of the cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"May 20, 2012

Does cottage cheese count as cheese or is that more like a kefir?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It's more like a cheese.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,So the same thing applies to cottage cheese?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Right.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"It’s just that because it still has some of its fluid in it you will have some bioactive
enzymes in cottage cheese that you won’t have in dry cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"September 9, 2007

But you’re saying the harder cheese...the softer cheese is actually better for you or they're not...
It depends on what you need."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If you need the molds to help break down toxicity in your
body then the softer cheeses are better."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If you need a magnet and a sponge to
bind with toxicity and then remove it from your body then harder cheese is better."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,So which is the harder cheese?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Farmer’s cheese?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Farmers cheese is soft.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,The dry cheese is the brick cheese.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Cheddar is hard.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Cheddar yeah, Jack...any of those."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"September 9, 2007

... keep cheese from molding?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"That’s the process of cheese, you know if you get American cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"The process of
making cheese is you take the dairy, you make it into curds and whey, you filter it out,
you dry out your curds, and you put it in cave."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,That’s the way cheeses are made.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Instead
of putting active acidophilus in the milk, you’re introducing a mold to predigest it the
same way as bacteria."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So that’s the only way you can eat hard cheeses, that you can
digest them, is if there’s mold in them."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Well there’s one way: you can eat a litle bit of
honey with your hard cheeses and you’ll be able to digest them."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Or you can pasteurize
them - make it from pasteurized milk - of course when that happens you’re going to
absorb toxins in the body and then re-digest it, reabsorb those chemicals, those toxins,
back into the body."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"When cheese is raw and unsalted the body does not digest it, it uses
it to attract toxins out of the neurological and lymphatic blood stream; even as it passes
out of the mouth it pulls it out of the system all the way through, till it leaves the body."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If
you eat honey directly with the cheese then you will digest the cheese, and if there are
any toxins in it you’ll reabsorb those toxins."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So I say eat cheese only twice a day with
honey, maybe thirty minutes after a meat meal, and that’s to give your calcium,
phosphorous, magnesium, potassium, all those good concentrated minerals,
supplementation."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Otherwise the cheese won’t be as digestible without having fungus or
mold in it."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,If you don’t want it to mold don’t refrigerate it.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Molds grow in cold
environments, so if you leave the cheese out to get warm [it won’t mold]."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"February 22, 2009

I came back from France: they say to mold the cheese, is that a good idea?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"That's a very good idea because we've all eaten lots of cooked cheese in our life, that
American stuff, Velveeta, how much Velveeta I ate, no wonder I was so sick."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"That stuff
was awful."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"May 6, 2000

I also found that if you put it in a dark place, it seems to...the mold is faster."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Right.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If you leave it out at room temperature...if you'll take it out of its package and then
let air in a plastic bag, like a ziplock bag with air in it, it will mold very quickly."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"There are all
different kinds of molds."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"That may be a difficult one, so only a little bit, cause I've seen
people get fatigue, so eat only a little bit."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Maybe a little, let's say molds on the outside
first, then work its way in over the month inside, so when it gets on the outside, if you
want it to go blue, to blue cheese, you need to let it sit a longer time."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If it's just the white
mold, that'll happen within a few days."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Shave some of that off.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"But I wouldn't have any
more than a thin shaving like this, about as wide as the brick is, and no more than 1""
long, per week."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"May 6, 2000

Should I stay away from cheese because of all the mold?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Let me tell you, these therapists don’t know their butt from a hole in the ground."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"All they
do is listen to doctors."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,They think the same way as doctors.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,The body is attacking itself.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If
you’re eating raw cheese that’s molded, and that’s how you make cheeses - the molds
predigest the cheese just like lactobacillus predigests your yogurt, your milk to make
yogurt and kefir."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It’s not a bad thing.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If it is mold grown on pasteurized cheese, you’ve got
a problem."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"But my people with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue – it depends on what’s
caused it – all eat cheese and honey and some fruit."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"They just have to eat it with a lot of
fat."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"July 10, 2007

Cheese will pull those toxins out of the body."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"It has to be raw, no-salt cheese and if it’s
moldy on the outside – if you see some white – just scrape it off."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"The mold inside is fine
but if you look at the white hair/moldy stuff under a microscope you’ll see hundreds of
thousands of microscopic mushrooms with spores."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"You can get too many spores at one
time in a sick body."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Just scrape off the surface; there are no mushrooms inside; only on
the surface."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If your body is not sick, you might be able to use the mold."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"July 10, 2007

Water with meat and cheese?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Cheese doesn't have a lot of enzymes.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So I would say eat some honey, just little bits of
honey just to get the enzymes in there so you can utilize it."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"It's better when you're first
starting out like that, to eat the meat with just very very little cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"And then you'll
probably have no trouble at all."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Did you drink anything, or have anything with it other than the cheese and meat?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Water?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Never EVER EVER drink water with meat and cheese.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"It will completely dilute your
acids."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,And then that stuff will sit in your stomach for quite a while.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"At least 40-50 minutes,
and usually meat and cheese should be gone out of the stomach in 20 minutes."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"May 6, 2000

When you gulp, most of the water is going to go right into the kidney and all those
nutrients have no way to get to your cells."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So, it causes dehydration because the body
wants to replace that water ...impossible."

activity between the nutrients and the water again."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If you blended water with some
cottage cheese, put a little honey or some fruit in it, February 3, 2013

I recommend that people eat small amounts of cheese to absorb the poisons that are
constantly dumping into the stomach and intestines."

not the healthy route for toxins to leave the body – 90% of toxins are supposed to leave
through the skin."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"October 14, 2012

How long do you store cheese in room temperature?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Until it gets very; cold in your house and you know mold will start growing.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,I’ve had it up to six months in my experiment.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Heat restricts it more from getting fungus, from getting mold, it’s tastier."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Just remember raw dairy never goes bad, it just turns into cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Well when you’ve got hair, fussy stuff all over the outside, those are mushrooms, those
are the spores."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,That can cause a heavy detoxification.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So you just scrape the outer stuff
off."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"February 22, 2009

So if you wanted heavy detox you could eat it [moldy cheese]?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Absolutely!
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Right.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Or you may get strong fatigue, you may get diarrhea and vomiting, so if
you’re ready for it, do it - If it doesn’t bother you."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"I know people who’ve been eating the
moldy cheese for ages, who simply say it never bothers me."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Well, they’re Germans, they’re really healthy with all that raunchy stinky awful smelling
cheese, and that’s all from mold."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"February 22, 2009

A good cheese
is one that’s been predigested with molds."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Germans love those stinky old cheeses that
have been broken down with the raunchiest molds in the world."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Look at their strength
when they used to eat so much of it."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Look at the 1800s and 1900s when they thought
they were the greatest race."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Part of that was because they ate so much steak tartar, even
more than France and they ate all of this raw moldy cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So they were an incredibly
healthy country of people."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"September 13, 2009

Can you leave that cheese out and dry it?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Will it change the properties of the cheese?

Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"I have been eating maybe 10 times more [ raw unsalted ] cheese than you
told me."

Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,I don’t care if you eat 10 pounds a day.

intestines and in 7 months he did that."

digest but it will allow you to utilize all your other foods to completely build and detox

you $1000 for one of those eggs."

Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"He gives the unwashed eggs,
I buy them buy the case."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"He doesn’t feed them any soy - just corn and he says he gives them
worms also."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,But I had a problem last August.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"You know, I buy a case, and usually I finish the
case and a couple go bad, and you know, I love...
Raw eggs don’t go bad, they just go stinky."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Well they would go to become a rotten egg, the classic rotten egg."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"And I love the classic rotten
eggs."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"But in August I was quite slow at eating my case of eggs and something rather strange
started happening to this case of eggs."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Instead of going bad, cause they were sitting, (it was
August, it was hot) - they were in my kitchen, I don’t have air conditioning in my place, but it’s
not direct sun or anything like that."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"It sure is hot but instead of becoming a classic rotten egg,
it would like just like break open and become this smelly brown and full of maggots."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"And now
I’m wondering whether I can still, I’ve still been buying eggs from this guy since August."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Is there
a problem with his eggs?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Every time you crack a shell and you get it warm enough, there are those little bitty fruit
fly worm, fruit flies that will lay their larva, and then get into the cracks because they’re
very tiny; they’re not like a regular fly."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"But instead of going bad, all these eggs, dozens of them turned into this stinky, uh, brown thing
of like, just full of maggots."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Good stuff.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,I could have eaten that?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Yeah, absolutely!"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,All that brown stuff is the maggots predigesting all those nutrients.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Their waste is usually
brown."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"There are some funguses in China when you have the century egg, it turns black
inside and not brown, but see white brown or black, depending on which egg you’re
buying."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,That’s a classic bad egg.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"But that stinky, smelly, completely brown..
Those are the maggots predigesting."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,They predigested the whole darn egg?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,What do your bowel movements smell like?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,I don’t smell them very often.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"But if you shit in your yard, what would it smell like?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It smells like shit.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It smells pretty foul.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Well that’s the food that’s most absorbable.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Once the bacteria and
E. coli have broken everything down, the body holds the fecal matter up in the sigmoid
colon in order to absorb all that foul stinky stuff, because that’s reducing to the
molecules, to feed the cells in the body."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Would it have been healthy to eat that brown smelly...
With the maggot too."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,With the maggots!
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So I could have just thrown it into a jar and gone around eating one of
these a day...
Absolutely!"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"No, that’s normal in the summertime, if the egg shell got cracked."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,How do I know it got cracked?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It just sat there.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"You wouldn’t know; you have to have a magnifying glass - a pretty powerful one - and see
if the eggs got cracked, and all they have to do is bump each other and they’ll put hairline
cracks."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,They seemed to just explode on their own.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,I do that.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,I do that.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"I’ll take - if it’s a hot summer - I’ll take a spoon and just tap them, and I
hear that crack go through them, and then I know."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"But sometimes I’d like to have a whole plate of these things, and they’d all go bad, the whole
thing."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Well that’s a week of good predigested egg.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"But there’s a difference between a rotten egg and these smelly brown things, or are they the
same?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Well, they’re not the same because you’ve got the parasites eating one, and you’ve got
fungus eating the other, and bacteria and fungus."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So I know you’ve always talked about how we should get parasites in our body, is this a good
way to get parasites in our body?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,That parasite is not an internal parasite.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Okay so that parasite is just going to be ingested by our bacteria.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,This is like that tribe that lives on maggots.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"They hunt, they slice the meat very thinly;
they lay it on a grill of twigs."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Then the maggots come and lay their eggs, their larva, and it
grows."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Then they’ll eat the maggots on the fifth day before they grow wings, and they get
big juicy maggots."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"That’s all they eat, and they can run 30 to 35 miles an hour."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Everything
is liquid and finely digested when it’s in a maggot."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,So that’s good stuff to eat?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,... absolutely good stuff to eat.

Eggs will never get to the bowel – no matter what form they are – high or not."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Eggs are assimilated in the stomach and small intestine?

Has your eating schedule changed since the recipe book?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Yes, you eat cheese first thing in the morning and have butter with it if you have a
tendency towards constipation."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So let's say for a big guy - like your size - I'd say two
tablespoons of cheese, a teaspoon of butter."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,... first in the morning?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Next after that, to get the brain going so you don’t have a lot of sugar in your nervous
system and so the brain functions and focuses properly, you eat eggs, two to three eggs,
five to ten minutes apart."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,And then go into the regular schedule?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Yes.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Then throughout the day, in between the meat meal and your fruit meal, you are
sipping on the milk and sport formula... and eating cheese periodically, to absorb the
poisons all day long."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,So the cheese is added and the sport formula is added.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Early in the morning, why do you have the cheese?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It will absorb all the poisons that have dumped into the stomach and intestines.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,...And what quantity of cheese per person?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It is all different; it depends on your size and level of toxicity.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"May 26, 2013

What do you usually eat for breakfast?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,I wake and have cheese.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,After that I suck an egg or two.

Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,I thought you had juice in the morning.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"I don’t do much juice anymore because it disturbs my balance of everything so I have my
juice later."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"For almost everybody else, you have your cheese, your juice with egg or egg
and then juice then egg again, depending on your condition."

Fat after protein
Should fat - butter and cheese - be eaten simultaneously with meat?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It depends on quantity.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If you're a weight-lifter or body builder and want to develop big
fast, have a full lubrication formula: 3-4 tbl with the meat and the rest 10-15 minutes
following because the protein will help you digest that fat."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Fat takes 3 times longer to

digest than proteins."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So it’s better to have most of the fat 10-15 minutes after the
protein, if you’re having a lot."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If you’re a weight-lifter and burn a lot of energy, you can
just gulp stuff like that."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,I can’t.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,I’ll sip it.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If you’re only having 1-2 tbl of fat, have it with the
meat as a sauce or however you want."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,But you want all the fat within 40 minutes.

and the honey?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Yeah.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Well, what I’ve done – I’ve changed that a little bit: 25 minutes after you’ve finished
the meat have a little sugar-cubed size amount of cheese; 10 minutes after that you have

Yeah."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"And let’s say I’ve got construction workers who are heavily toxic and laboratory
personal who deal with a lot of formaldehyde and mercury – I have them eat a cube
every 15 minutes."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So, they’ll take that and wait seven minutes, drink some sport formula
or milk, or milkshake and then seven minutes have that piece of cheese again – and they
do that all day long."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"When it comes to a meal of course they don’t eat that cheese during
that half of the meal, but they eat it 10 minutes before the meal and then about 25
minutes after the meal they have cheese again, then 10 minutes after that is when you
have honey and cheese together."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"When you have cheese without honey without fruit you
do not digest the cheese; there are no enzymes in dehydrated food, no matter what it is."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So, you have to have honey or some kind of fruit – like an acidic fruit – like pineapple or
papaya – to provide the enzymes to digest that cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So, twice a day I recommend that
25 minutes after your meal you have a little piece of cheese, 10 minutes after that you

have your cheese with honey and that’s your mineral supplement."

Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"The stomach works in 40-minute cycles, just like we have dream states
and go into REM [ rapid eye movement ] every 40 minutes."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So if you eat your cheese and
wait 10 minutes, you have 30 minutes to eat your meal."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If you eat cheese first, your body
will start dumping poisons from the stomach that it needs to get rid of."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If you stop eating
for ten minutes, it stops dumping poisons with the hydrochloric acid."

I have a client - another one in Massachusetts - who is a very wealthy, influential woman,

she has a scientist friend who is a very elderly doctor and is 80."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"And he's done all this
research and he said that is true, people should eat raw eggs, why didn't I think about it?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"We found enzymes and protein in a raw egg white that is destroyed by oxygen, and we've
been trying to figure out how to...and it dissolves cancer."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Cancer cannot live in an
environment with these enzymes and proteins."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So if you just eat the egg without
whipping it, it won't be destroyed by the oxygen."

something like that, that'll prevent it from oxidizing."

these toxic minerals; they're being thrown into the bowel."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"And all this fatty cheese,
absorbs it."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It hardens it.

What I don’t understand stand is we have toxins that are distributed throughout our body,
right, because they get past the intestinal wall into the bloodstream or whatever."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So how does
consuming fat in your mouth that’s in your digestive tract pull out those toxins from the body?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It doesn’t pull them out necessarily.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Well, cheese will."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"But what happens is the body is
wise."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Your white blood cells are fatty cells basically.

Gastritis
Gastritis happens a lot of times when you have gas."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"You have toxins that dump into the
intestinal wall and there’s not enough mucus to harness them - in the mucus lining."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"It’s
almost always in people who are too thin, especially when you have Crohn’s disease or
any kind of inflammatory bowel system."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"They don’t create mucus properly, enough to
protect the lining."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So the poisons don’t get locked into the mucus, they get into the
digestive tract where the food is."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Then your digestive juices mix with those poisons and it
creates gas."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Gas can cause severe pain, diarrhea, headaches."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"You have to eat cheese until

Do less."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Just do less.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"But if you're having two tablespoons of cheese and only two
teaspoons of honey then you're mashing the cheese together and mixing it in your
mouth before you swallow it, you're never going to have that reaction."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"I
wasn't doing that."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,You're right.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,So the gas is from not eating enough of the cheese?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Yeah, well, it is from your digestive juices mixing with the poisons that are dumping into
your stomach and your intestines, that creates gas."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,OK?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If the cheeses are in there
absorbing the poisons they're not going to mix with the enzymes and your bacteria, so
you're not going to have gas."

Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"No, I just do not know any way you can get rid of it without eating raw meat."

Okay, whenever you have heart palpitations or pounding hearts after a vegetable juice,
you have to whisk an egg into it."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"What’s happening is the enzymes that you’re getting in
the vegetable juice are pulling out heavy metals."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"The heart does not want to allow those
heavy metals to lock into the tissue part or any other glands, so it sends the blood more
racing through the body."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So the blood passes through the intestinal tracts more often
and that poison will hopefully dump into the intestinal tract and not the heart, brain or
one of the glands."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"What do you mean, do you just stir it?"

For those who had raw milk available, slowly drinking a blended mixture of 1 cup warm

eggs, ½ to 1 whole unripe raw unripe banana and as much unheated honey as desired
usually took them through the night."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If bananas were not appealing, another fresh unripe
raw fruit mixed with 3-4 tablespoons unheated honey worked."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Do not make a smoothie with berries or apple.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Berries mixed with raw egg often causes
drugs and toxic minerals to detoxify from glands, and apple excites adrenals."

combination may interfere with sleep."

Leaky Gut
Eating liquid food is paramount."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Raw milk and raw eggs are ideal foods for leaky gut
because they are liquid and require only intestinal bacteria to digest them."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"In fact, raw
milk and raw eggs are resplendent with bacteria that help our intestinal bacteria digest."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,The bacteria in those foods are helpful not harmful.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"I suggest that people suffering leaky gut eat lots of whole raw eggs from chickens that are
fed meat scraps, crushed raw bones, worms (maggots) and fermented dairy."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Eggs are the
most easily digested food."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Because they are already liquid and contain lots of quick-

reproducing bacteria, eggs digest in about 30 minutes."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Although liquid, one cup of raw milk still requires about 6-10 hours to completely digest."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Eggs and milk provide nutrients for the body to produce necessary mucus.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Milkshakes
(raw milk, raw eggs and unheated honey blended together) help build the mucus
necessary to protect and heal stomach and intestinal linings quickly."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"However, the digestive tract may be so compromised that a person may get cramps from
drinking milkshakes."

long."

from milkshakes one day of every 12 days."

Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,I can only give you a theory based on the fact that it works.

hormones that could be released all throughout the body - the body can utilize them
anywhere, so it doesn't have to deliver them to the pancreas and the pancreas then has
to deliver it back to the stomach like it does with cooked food."

transition and transference can happen all over the body."

I have really bad mineral problems since I was young so I eat cheese with honey to mineralize."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Would your cheesecake be similar in re-mineralizing?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If
you’re putting the honey in the cheese butter part simultaneously, yes; if you’re mixing
the honey with the butter first, then it won’t work."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"It will realize the minerals in the
cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,You still need to eat raw cheese alone [ or just with butter ] to remove poisons.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,If you eat cheese with fruit does it still act as a poison sponge?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Does it act as a detoxifier?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"You will digest some of that cheese and maybe re-digest the poisons, unless it’s a fruit
with high pectin in which case it will detoxify you and won’t reabsorb."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Dates, figs, all
berries, and some apples and pears are all high in pectin."

Mineralize after vinegar
Just remember: if you have a lot of vinegar, you’re going to decalcify, demineralize, your
system."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,So you have to eat enough cheese to keep up with that.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,What's enough cheese?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,... enough cheese?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If you are having a teaspoon of vinegar, I would say you need at least
three tablespoons of cheese in a day. -"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"if I wanted to make lemonade – if I want to take fresh lemons let’s say and put some raw
honey in it and just drink it."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Is that ok?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It is not a good thing to have very often.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"You can put cream in it – maybe eat some
cheese before you drink it - so you don’t demineralize, because lemonade with the honey
and the lemon will cause de-mineralization in the system."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If you eat cheese before you
eat and a little dairy cream in your lemonade, it’s ok."

Morning sickness & cheese during pregnancy

If she has a lot of toxins in the body you want to eat a lot of cheese often so you don’t go
into morning sickness."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Morning sickness is the body detoxing very toxic substances that
dump into the stomach."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Vomit, vomit, vomit because the body does not - or the baby, the
placenta does not - want this poison going into the baby."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So the mother has to vomit and

vomit and vomit, so if she’s eating cheese regularly, like a little piece every hour, it’ll help
keep the baby strong."

Nausea
Eating this cheese will absorb those poisons as the body dumps them into the stomach
rather than out the skin and it does that."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"The lymph system takes its waste and dumps it
under the skin to be perspired out of the skin."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If it’s jammed it won’t do it, so it dumps it
into the mucous membranes and if you get a cold or a flu or you’re spitting up mucous
regularly – that’s elimination through your mucous membranes; the mucous membranes
of the intestinal tract also – that’s where most of them get dumped."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Whenever you get
nauseous that’s an indication that something’s toxic you’ve just eaten, or somewhere else
stored in your body is going to the stomach and dumping into the stomach."

Nervous system and brain – how to feed them
High meat and high eggs - do you eat those on an empty stomach?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Should it be separated
from every other thing?"

can eat it with a regular meat meal or....
You can combine it with a normal meat meal."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,How many times do you crack the eggs to get them high? ...
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"All the way around ... get it cracked all the way around, then you put it near the sun

with the nervous system; they’ll only help a tiny bit."

Cheese with honey... Do you spit it out?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,No that’s oil pulling.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,When you have honey with cheese it’s to digest the cheese.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"You don’t
digest no-salt, raw cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,There are no enzymes and it’s just going to absorb poisons.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So, to get your concentrated minerals, you mix a slight bit of honey with the cheese like
1:3."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So if it’s three tablespoons of cheese, it’s three teaspoons of honey."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"I do less: only
one and half to two teaspoons of honey to digest my cheese."

because of all the mineral loss from those poisons in my body."

Nuts
All nuts have enzyme suppressants in them."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If you eat them by themselves, it will prevent
you from digesting proteins."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"It could also make you depressed or sluggish; it manifests
differently for each person."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"That is why I always suggest you blend them to a powder,
mix in an egg or some kind of fat – cream, peanut oil, coconut butter, butter...

...4 oz of nuts (either pine nuts, walnuts, pecans halves – any combination) and 3 oz of
your given choice of fat, 1 egg, 1-2 tsp of honey (depending on how sweet you like it) and
blend that."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"That way the butter and the honey will convert the enzyme suppressant into
an enzyme active ingredient."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"May 21, 2000

Most people do not digest nuts."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,There is an enzyme suppressant in all nuts.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So the
formula I gave which breaks that down which is: four oz."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"of nuts (pecans, walnuts, filberts,
pine nuts, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds) – any one of those or any combination of all
six of them."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Blend them to a powder.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Blend one to two eggs; two tbsp.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"of honey, three to
four oz."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"of cream, raw coconut cream, butter, of the Spectrum peanut oil which is light

yellow in color."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Blend that for about 30-50 seconds and there you will digest just about
everything."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,That formula took me years to come up with that.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"It neutralizes the
enzymatic suppressants in nuts without germinating them."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Once you germinate them –
soak them – you turn them into a vegetable, so you do not digest them very well."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"You are
caught between a rock and a hard place."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"When you eat that formula it neutralizes the
enzyme inhibitors in the nuts."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"November 17, 200

Does sprouting seeds and nuts help with digestion?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It makes it worse.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It turns it into a vegetable.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So if you want to take nuts and do what I do,
I make a paste of it, I'll make a nut butter sauce, or like a pudding, I'll take 1/2 cup of
either walnuts which are very soft and the oil's pretty good, and/or pecans, rarely use
almonds because they're so difficult to digest, pine nuts, and macadamia nuts, if you can
find them non-kiln-dried in the shell, otherwise any already-shelled macadamia is going
to be kiln-dried at 110 degrees or more."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It makes it very difficult to digest.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"What I do is
take 1/2 cup nuts, one of those four, and I'll blend them into a powder, and then I'll add
peanut oil or butter and egg, definitely put an egg in, if I have butter I'll use butter first,
raw cream second, peanut oil third."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,And I'll add 1-2 tbsp honey.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"And sometimes tsp of
raw carob powder and blend that together and have myself a little pudding treat."

found no ill effects from eating the nuts that way."

Osteoporosis
Yeah, so if you want to do that - if anybody has osteoporosis - you have at least about 2
ozs of cheese and that’s a lot of cheese at one time and you have half that amount of
butter with it and a sixth that amount of honey, so you’d have 1 tablespoon honey for 1oz
butter, 2ozs of cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"May 23, 2010

When you want to restore bone – if you have osteoporosis, that’s what she has – you
need to eat cheese with honey after each meat meal."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"This is usually recommended if
somebody has osteoporosis: 2 tablespoons of cheese – raw, no-salt cheese – with about
2 teaspoons of honey, maximum."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"You can cut it down to 1 teaspoon per 2 tablespoons of
cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,A small amount of honey is all it takes.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"That way you will digest the minerals in
the cheese and you cannot get any higher concentration of minerals than you can in raw,
no-salt cheese."

Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Honey.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Can you repeat that again?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It is two tbsp.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,raw no salt cheese with one ½ to two tsp.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,honey.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"And the honey and the
cheese have to go down the throat together, so you can mash them or put the honey and
the cheese in your mouth at the same time."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Now, when you eat anything dehydrated
there are no bio-active enzymes."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Food will not digest properly without leaching nutrients
from some other area of your body."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"However, honey is mainly enzymes for digestion."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So,
when you eat the honey with the cheese you provide yourself with the nutrients to digest
the cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Because it is so concentrated it’s like taking this much milk and reducing it to
this and concentration of minerals."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"When you eat it with the honey mainly it’s the
minerals – it’s a mineral supplement."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"It would be like taking a bottle of rock minerals that
you will never digest anyway because we don’t digest rock minerals."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"But in cheese form,
those minerals are already in food form."

thirty minutes after a meat meal: one to two tablespoons of cheese with a very small
amount of honey."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,The honey and the cheese have to go together.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"To digest a dry food
substance you have to have honey or some other enzyme with it that will allow it to be
digested."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Cheese eaten without honey directly in it, like in cheesecake, will be digested."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"But without honey directly in it, it acts as a magnet and a sponge for poisons and it goes
off and you discard it."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"You don't digest any cheese unless you have honey directly with
that cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So most of the cheese you eat should be the sponge and the magnet for
drawing all those poisons out of the body and take them out."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Two times a day, thirty
minutes after a meat meal, you have the cheese and the honey together; say you have
one and a half tablespoons of cheese."

and I'll speak."

herself up, made the pain formula, drank it all at one time, with the amount of cheese
that I told her to eat which was for the whole thing, 1/4-1/3 brick of cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Cheddar
works a little bit better if you're a person who gets migraines it's better to use the other
cheeses."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,And only cuts it down maybe 5% of its value of its therapy.

thing at once and ate all the cheese at once."

any cramps for the rest of that time."

Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,You can add 1tsp of honey if you like - only a tsp.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,What kind of cheese?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,...Cheddar - the raw no-salt-added cheddar cheese.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"You can use any of the other raw no-
salt-added cheeses like the Munster or the Monterey."

[Here is] my formula for any kind of pain except for migraines, and it works."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"I have even
refined what I have in the book."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,The one in book works 85 % of the time.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Now it works

95% of the time."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"At least that is what I have been exploring in the last 1 ½ years: 2 eggs,
3 - 4 oz of cream, tsp lemon or lime, 5-6 heaping tbsp of fresh soft bee pollen."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"My
suggestion is that, if you have pain, do not go 5-6 hours without having another 1-2 oz."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Now that formula will work for 80-90% of the pain.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"The way I got it up another 10-15% I
got them to eat cheese with it."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So with the first 3 oz of that formula if you take an 1” by 1
½ “ which is the thickness of the brick of cheese and eat that along with your 3 oz the first
time, then after that with 1-2 oz per oz you eat 1 sugar cube sized amount of the cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,If you eat more cheese does that throw it off?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Sometimes it can but most often times it does not.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"And it can cause a little dehydration
because it is not getting into the blood as quickly."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If you had a little drink of water, or
milk, that will help elevate that if you have a little more cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"This works for any pain
except migraines."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Jan. 22, 2000

if you're having pain, cheese and this pain formula are your best bet."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"It doesn't work in
some cases like migraines, but it works in joint and tooth problems, bruises, knee
injuries, any kind of injury."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It does not work more than 50% with headaches.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"And with the
cluster headaches, it still only works maybe 30%."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"But in every other case, it works
anywhere from 60-90%."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It will mitigate the pain.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Sometimes it will relieve it entirely, any
pain, even tooth abscesses."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"And those are the worst in my opinion except if you split a
bone."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"One egg, preferably 3oz cream - if you don't have cream, cow's cream, use coconut
cream - 3oz of milk and 6 heaping tbsp of fresh bee pollen."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Now it has to be the bee
pollen that's refrigerated, and crumbles in your fingers, just comes apart - very soft."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If it's
pellets, it's been heated, kiln-dried, and cooked."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It will not have the same effect.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"ALSO
ADD LEVEL TSP OF LEMON OR LIME JUICE."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Blend that together, and drink at least 4oz
right away and about 1-2oz every 3-4 hours as you need it for pain."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"And keep re-making it
as you need it."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,It doesn't make very well in larger quantities.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"It doesn't blend as well for
some reason."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"November 7, 1999

...1-2oz every 2-4 hours as you need it for pain."

cheese, about the size of a sugar cube, any of the raw unsalted cheeses, bite that off,
have a sip of it then chew them together."

deal with it all."

Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,I have found that it really does not make the blade glide properly.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"When I use butter,
cream, whipped cream on my face it still causes me to cut myself."

What’s the best way to help re-mineralize your teeth?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Just the way I said it: Eat cheese often, so your body’s not using your key minerals to bind
with the poisons."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"When you’re eating the cheese and honey together, you’re filling your
body with tremendous amounts of... If you’ve got a real serious problem at any
particular time, you do that three times a day: twice after a meat meal because you’re
only having one meat meal a day – that means you have to take it two other times – and
the middle of the night is the one time in the middle of the night that is best."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"And that’ll
help if you stick with it."

Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Yeah.

Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Do you eat the cheese and honey 10 minutes before a cheese?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"You eat the cheese – it’s always the cheese 10 minutes before you have the cheese and
honey."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Yeah, but even in the middle of the night do you do it?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Yeah, still I have a piece of cheese first but you don’t have to wait a full 10 minutes; 5
minutes is fine during the middle of the night."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"And when you have that cheese with
honey it should be about a three to one ratio – maximum."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So, let’s say you’re having a
tbsp."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"of cheese, you have a tsp."

Rotten/high egg
Is rotten egg OK?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"I was buying a basket of 200 eggs from a village while in China

Absolutely!"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"However, those eggs are put in clay and dirt."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"They don’t have a lot of bacteria
and are mostly broken down with fungus."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So,
to make a high egg do you just poke a hole and put it outside?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"No
hole or you’ll have maggots and tiny flies."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"They would digest differently and would feed
the glands a little bit but wouldn’t necessarily feed the brain and nervous system."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"When I
really want an egg to rot well and predigest, I take the rounded side of a metal spoon and
tap it until I hear a big crack."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Then I’ll keep turning and tapping all the way around getting
big cracks, not tearing the membrane."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Then the oxygen isn’t really getting in.

Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"All you do is take cheese and honey
three times a day."

eat them together in your mouth."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Raw cheeses do not digest in the human digestive

tract."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"The body uses it as a sponge for chelation to draw out poisons and passes them
out through the feces."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Cooked cheese does the same thing but, it will absorb all of those
poisons but then it gets reabsorbed into the body because it’s been cooked, it’s all
fractionated."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"But somehow the body knows with the raw cheese how to handle it and
just passes it out."

Skin – soothing and protecting
Only butter will do that, cream won't do that."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Cream won't even get near the skin; cream
is all absorbed by the glands and the organs, and nervous system."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Butter is the only thing
that will get to the skin from ingesting - especially if you are using the
lubrication/moisturizing formula - because it allows it to be slowly pre-digested with the
lemon juice and the egg in it, so it allows the liver to handle it easily and get it to the skin."

Skin lesions
What do you recommend for mild lesions?"

Survival foods

Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Well, I'd still take some cheese."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"So for breakfast, lunch and dinner you'd say just butter, honey and cheese?"

Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Seeds are a little bit better.

butter and I would take an egg, at least one egg, a day."

How do you use foods in survival kit - such as cheese, butter, figs, dates - instead of raw milk?"

Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"One
main thing would be lots of butter and if it turns into blue cheese it’s even better as you’ll
digest more of it."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Normally, when you eat butter you’re digesting about 70% of it."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If you

way I see you're going to get rid of that bile."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"You don't have to do it every day, all the time,
but you need to just load your body up with it, you need to get fat around here, and then
take it off, and get fat around there, because if this bile with that kind of metal toxicity

holes in your intestines."

make sure you can build that up."

by egg white...
The spell check when my book was done, and I talk about that in my book, it substituted
the avidin for albumen."

albumen, that's supposed to be avidin."

body."

utilization."

How to get stem cells
Have you eaten unrefrigerated, fertile eggs with developing chick for their stem cells?"
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,I’ve eaten bunches of them in China.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"They eat a lot of those in Asia and usually go older
so that when you open it, the chick is more developed - sometimes with cartilage and
bone developing – rubbery."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Stem cells is a theory that hasn’t been proven.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"You’re not
going to digest most of the egg when it is developing into a chick unless you’ve been
eating a Primal Diet for 20 years, know how to generate a lot of hydrochloric acid, or you

Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"You can let it
start developing but once the sinew and tendons start developing you’re just not going to
digest it well unless you’ve been on the diet a long time."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Are there other ways to generate stem cells?
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Well, you can eat eggs, bone marrow, testes or sperm but have to find a healthy animal
or person."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Feeding a chicken a vegetarian diet is the worst thing you can do.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Chickens are

Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,They’re mainly scavengers and eat rotten meat and bugs.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If they eat
rotten meat – which they prefer, they won’t eat bugs."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,They eat carcasses like vultures.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"That’s why I have Amish farmers butchering their animals and leaving what they don’t
use for the chickens who eat it as it rots as well as the ensuing maggots."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Usually you see

chickens going around pecking each other – because they’re starving."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"These Amish
chickens that are fed my way are walking around rubbing against your leg like a cat and
never pecking each other – none of that."

Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"How to avoid toxicity in chicken and eggs

(Remedy to remove soy toxicity is in last paragraph)

Eliminate Soy Toxicity In Poultry Meat And Eggs: Many poultry feeds contain antibiotics,
hormones, arsenic and toxic soy protein."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"The reasons that arsenic is used in feed are to
keep insects and rodents from eating feeds, and as an antibiotic."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Antibiotics are used to
suppress symptoms of and hide diseases."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Hormones and soy proteins are used to hasten

and increase growth."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"All of those compounds are toxic and dangerous, causing diseases,
including cancer, heart, osteoporosis and diabetes."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"I covered Arsenic in my
accompanying article, ""Arsenic In Poultry Meat And Eggs; Another Cancer Connection""."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Here, of course, the topic is soy."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Soy must be treated to alter natural substances in it that cause sickness or death to
poultry and humans when eaten."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"The beans must be bathed in acidic baths and heated
at extreme temperatures."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Then they spray-dry it with nitrates to produce protein powder,
and add artificial (chemical) flavorings, MSG, preservatives, sweeteners and other
synthetic ingredients to trick the pallet of poultry and humans to eat the toxic matter."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"According to Dr. Jonathan V. Wright, MD, nitrates have been known for decades to cause
cancer, yet the FDA allows them in many foods."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Soy contains many phytoestrogens, IGg
and trypsin inhibitor that have caused cancers and inhibited growth in hundreds of
animals."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,There are many websites that site toxicity and tests utilizing soy chemicals.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Search: ""Soy toxic""."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Poultry, especially chicken fed high ratios of soy protein to increased meat and egg
production, taste unappetizing."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"The more soy in the feed, the blander and oddly
unappealing is the taste."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Fifty years ago, the population would have rejected eggs and
poultry meat that tasted like that."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Poultry grown on mainly corn and other grains is rich
and healthy-tasting, as well as health-giving."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Very often, poultry meat and eggs that are labeled organic are fed mainly soy, such as
Rosie Organic Chicken."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"It is not only a misnomer, it is an outright advertising fraud."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Even
though the soy that is fed to its chickens was organically grown, when the soy is
processed with chemicals and used as feed, it fails to be organic."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Rosie ""Organic"" Chicken
feeds its chickens up to 75% chemically-treated and processed soy."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"To get your poultry and eggs producers to grow tastier and healthier meat and eggs, I
suggest that you write to them, give them this information and ask them to feed their
poultry raw meat scraps (fresh or rank poultry love rank raw meat because they are

omnivorous scavengers) for protein, and corn and other grains for delicious, flavorful
and healthy meat and eggs."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"If they need a good mineral supplement to make eggshells
stronger, suggest that they add a little Terramin clay (www.terramin.com) to their feed."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"To gradually remove soy byproduct toxicity from within the body, I suggest eating a
combination of 23 ounces coconut cream, 1inch cube no-salt-added raw cheese, 1

tablespoon unheated honey, 23inches section of unripe raw banana and 13 raw eggs."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,Eating enough raw meat daily helps remove body-stored soy protein toxicity.
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Many laboratory tests have proved that arsenic causes cancer even at low levels currently
found in our environment."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Also, evidence suggests that arsenic contributes to other
diseases, such as diabetes, heart, and decline of mental function."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Humans are exposed
to arsenic directly from its natural occurrence in the earth’s crust but arsenic is mined
and then used commercially."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Drinking water, rice, and playground equipment are a few
of the daily exposures to cancer-causing arsenic."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"The Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) finally lowered its long-outdated arsenic drinking-water standard by fivefold in 2001."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Arsenic contaminates many of your favorite foods, including rice and chicken,
intentionally."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"In this article, we focus on chicken meat and eggs."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"For many
decades, chicken farmers have been feeding chickens arsenic to hasten and increase
growth and conceal symptoms of disease at youthful stages of chicken development."
Benefits_of_Raw_Eggs.txt,"Of
the 8.7 billion American broiler chickens produced each year, at least 70 percent have
been fed arsenic."

removed."
The_Recipe_for_Living_Without_Disease.txt,"That isolation, dissolution, neutralization, secretion

quality supply of vitamins and enzymes to the functions of
digestion, assimilation and utilization of cooked and processed

it because they have great energy produced by hormones from
overactive glands."
The_Recipe_for_Living_Without_Disease.txt,"That means they have an over-abundance of
hormones."
The_Recipe_for_Living_Without_Disease.txt,"Much of the hormonal overproduction is from toxic
junk food full of preservatives, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides,
chemical fertilizers, hormones, antibiotics and other drugs fed to
crops and animals we eat."
The_Recipe_for_Living_Without_Disease.txt,"Those hormones are often used by
their bodies to replace the destroyed nutrients in cooked and
processed food, to stimulate energy levels, and to mask illness-
symptoms without eliminating disease."
The_Recipe_for_Living_Without_Disease.txt,"Many of those people’s
glands become too toxic, may harden later in life and/or become
fatigued."
The_Recipe_for_Living_Without_Disease.txt,"Most often, those people do not realize they are

constant types of microbes attacking the body from outside."
The_Recipe_for_Living_Without_Disease.txt,"Contrary to Pasteur, his contemporary, Dr. Antoine Bechamp,

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","@Source

I'm Aajonus Vonderplanitz and I got into health because I was a very sickly
individual."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I was born into a violent household.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","One of my brothers was 18
months older and still in diapers when I was born,."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He was very distressed about
taking mother's attention away and so he would torture me regularly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When I was
about 6 months old he knocked my hand out from under me; I fell on a rake - and
the rusty rake went into my neck and my mother was a nurse and she had this
phobia about lockjaw - tetanus - so I was rushed to the hospital and given a
tetanus shot - my first- at about 6 months old."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was sick for about a month
after that - from the reaction to that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That was in the mid-forties so they
didn't acknowledge anything at all like that then.. There was no such thing as a
reaction to a vaccine in those days."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So 6 months later, my brother made sure that I fell on a rusty nail and my
mother - again - took me to the doctor and got another tetanus shot ... and 6
months after that, again."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But on the third one, it made me autistic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was unable to communicate; I was
unable to associate words or the written language to any kind of a concept."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","My
brain just wouldn't accept it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So I grew up just repeating whatever I heard.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had an attention span and a
memory span about like this."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, if I heard something, I had to ask many times
... what, what, what, what, what,t, what...

So by the time I was 8 years old, I had heard enough phrases over and over that
I could just repeat the phrases."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So I spit out - parroting whatever I heard.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In
my house it was things like 'shut up, sit down, you're stupid...

So when I went to school, I started giving that stuff back to the other kids...
They didn't take that well, so I was constantly getting beat up and never
understood why."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When I was about 4 years old, after that tetanus shot when I was 18 months old,
I was very sickly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I would get colds at about three months old then at about 8
years old, even longer because by then I would be getting vaccines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The polio
vaccine came out in ‘58 so I was 11 years old when that came out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Then I started having real problems.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Right after the first polio vaccine , the
second polio vaccine, I got peritonitis, which is a perforated and bleeding
small intestine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They put me through all kinds of stuff; they were injecting me
every 2 - 3 hours."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They packed me in ice because my fever went up to 107
degrees."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But they treated it at first like an appendicitis because that is what they
thought it was."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was in school about probably about 4 days after I had my
second polio shot and I had intestinal cramps; I couldn't move."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I just buckled
over in school and on the playground or outside the church and could not move...
I was buckled up in such pain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was rushed to the hospital; they said it was
peritonitis."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They went in to take out the appendix - found it in great shape,
nothing wrong with it but they took it out anyway just in case it caused me
problems in the future."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And that is the epitome of the medical profession i.e. vaccines that are full
of nothing but five basic poisons: liquid mercury, liquid aluminum,
formaldehyde, ether and detergent. -"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","in every vaccine - even those that claim to
be mercury-free now."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They don't say mercury-free now; they say
'thimerosol-free'."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, what they did: they have 11 names for liquid mercury - so
they stopped using one called 'thimerosol."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They are still using liquid mercury
in these vaccines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, every child is given from one vaccine 1236 times the
toxic dose that the FDA says. ..."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",One vaccine!
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You've got anywhere from 22 to 53 other toxic ingredients.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Every one of those
ingredients is toxic on their own merit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then when you have a soup of these
toxins, you are already expected to believe that this soup of toxins - that are
critically toxic - are somehow good for your health."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The amount of so-called virus in them (now, remember, vaccines are to combat
virus) - virus has never been proved."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you look at all the latest
photographs - so-called photographs - or so called photographs of viruses - you
will see that you have got these kind of amoeba-looking things with these warts
coming out all over them - or tentacles coming out all over them and all kinds
of odd shapes, These are all computer-generated, the way Walt Disney
computer-generates."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",There is not one photograph because virus are not alive.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That was known 50 years ago!
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It was ridiculous to give an antibiotic for a virus because there was nothing
alive in a virus."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","All you found was dead cells, dissolved dead human cells."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","We
didn't know what was dissolving them, what was the medium to do that, how was
the body responding, and why."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Still those questions are not answered - but the
pharmaceutical industry decided that they could make a lot more money if we
believed that virus were alive."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So now they prescribe antibiotics for viruses.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And there is no such thing as a virus unless you look at it as a solvent.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Because what happens - when a cell can't be dissolved naturally, with a bacteria
or a parasite or a fungus, it makes solvents."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","A cell will make a solvent to
dissolve dead cells to get rid of them.- to recycle them - to get them out of
the body any wastes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So the whole idea of fighting virus by creating cells from another animal ...
because they always blame it on other animals, you notice, except the first
deadly flu was the Spanish flow - they blamed it on the Spaniards."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","After that,
it has all been animals."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","e.g. bird flu, swine flu, pig flu, - all kinds of flus."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And even the black plague was blamed on the rats.;
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I will tell you about that
one later."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So these poisons are injected into all of us, and our children."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","From my
research, it creates 70% of all diseases."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It makes you the low-functioning
individuals - the most low-functioning individuals in the world."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I have visited
tribes and I have visited communities all over the world that had NO vaccines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Their degree of health is astronomical.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I have a farm in the Philippines - way
out in the jungles -, away from civilization - nothing but tribes out there- and
I hired anybody from 20 years old to 50 years old - to dig these fish-ponds
which are 60' X 30' X22’ deep."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",They dig them by hand.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They take these pails;
they fill the pails then they pitch them up."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So you get all this network of
people."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had two of them (fish-ponds) dug, plus a swimming pool."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","These people
would work 10 hours a day without a hitch - no problem."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When I was at my
grandparents' farm, when I was a child - you would see these 50 year old men
throwing thirty, fifty, sixty pound bales of hay 15 feet up into a loft."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now,
people are using fork-lifts because they can't do it any more."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","We don't have the
strength So, you have to take a look at why...and it is mainly vaccines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","One of those tribes' individuals had been living in the city and had got
vaccines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",He was the only employee that did not work consistently and hard.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So,
he got the easy jobs and yet he was buff, taller-than-normal (than the other)
Asians that were working for me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","yet, he would go off and do all kinds of
things - do anything to avoid hard labor."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was abused as a child because I was considered lazy but after all these
vaccines, especially in the right arm, I couldn't lift my right arm this far
without excruciating pain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",going all the way up my neck and into my head.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","To
walk, to breathe, was a great chore for me - very painful - so I avoided any
kind of work."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now, my father grew up on the farm so he was a hardy kid."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He grew
up on the raw milk and everything fresh from this farm."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So he couldn't
understand why he had a retarded child that was also a weakling."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So he just
thought that I was just a lazy kid."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, I got beaten a lot, because of that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He
put me in the hospital three times, broke my ear drums; he told me 'listen to
me' and would whack me in both ears so I lost 80% of hearing in one ear and 60%
in the other."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This was the way it was in my childhood.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","By the time I was 8 years
old, I was keeping colds up to 5 months."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","After the episode of peritonitis at 12
years old, I was sick the year round."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I was bed-ridden at least 3 months a year.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then at 15 1/2, I got my third polio shot."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They delayed it because of my
reactions."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Finally they did correlate it to the second vaccine - the
peritonitis."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The mercury went into my intestines, burned a whole in my
intestines, and the formaldehyde and ether caused the damage."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That particular
doctor was not the normal doctor that I went to."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","My father was an inventor for General Electric - military Division - in
Cincinnati, Ohio."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That particular doctor for General Electric was on vacation
when this happened."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I was taken to a different doctor for the first time, and
of course he correlated right away 'What did you do in the last few days?'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","..'What did you eat... what happened... As soon as I said 'the vaccine', he did
a blood test and the mercury level was extremely high."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It was thimerosol-type
mercury poisoning because there is a difference."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","There is a difference between
the liquid mercury that you use in a thermometer and the one that you use in
pharmaceuticals."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",They are all very toxic.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It's just that when you have aluminum
bound with the mercury, it lessens its lethal ability; it slows it, is what it
does."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Also, the aluminum is put in the vaccines to hold those toxins into the
body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you were to get a shot without liquid aluminum, Did anyone say 'aluminium'
here - when I am in South Africa, they don't know what I am talking about when
say aluminium."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",OK so aluminum.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It holds the toxins in the body - indefinitely!
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",For a whole lifetime if you don't know how to remove it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And it is very
difficult to remove it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It took me many many many years of experimentation to
find out how."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Let me tell you what can happen.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",We're going to get into this in the detoxification part.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I have a client in
Sweden - brought to me at 3 years old - completely autistic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That was his life.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Now he is in school and functioning completely at 6 years old.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This was the
fastest-ever-recovering one ever because this parent did what I asked."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I asked
to feed him a moldy raspberry along with the diet every day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And she did it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The
child repaired faster than any other child."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","All of the children on this diet
recover slowly in 6 or 7 years but this child recovered completely in 3 years
because that mother bothered to make the moldy raspberries and give him one a
day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It makes all the difference in the world.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That fungus turns into a mycelium
in the body and can attach and break down the mercury and aluminum combination -
the formaldehyde, the ether and all the other things that are in there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It can
actually break down that tissue attached to those minerals and remove it from
the system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So the child's brain was able to heal.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Can you imagine in three
years, having a child that is like this."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Do you think he is going to be like
that forever?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Talking, eating, going to school… everything, beautifully."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Now the medical profession will never achieve that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They will never achieve
that because they are responsible for causing it, with their vaccines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And they
did it with me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So when I got my third polio vaccine at 15 1/2, it gave me
juvenile diabetes, it stopped my pancreas from working, because of the toxins
stored in there, and stored in my heart giving me angina pectoris and muscle
spasms in and around the heart."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I had 300 heart attacks between the age of 15
1/2 and 22 - sometimes three a week."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They would see me at school, grabbing my
chest, dropping my arm and passing out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",They rushed me to the hospital.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now the
doctors don't look for any cause that could be chemical."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They look - at that
time especially, they looked for congenital heart malformation or congestive
heart failure."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, they had a lot of plaque on my arteries."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I didn't have either so they told my parents my heart attacks were all in my
head."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Here you've got a retarded child who comes up with the idea of having
heart attacks (?) ..."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","and I can fake them that well that I can actually go
unconscious (?)."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You have to think about these doctors' mentality.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They are in
denial, constantly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So here I started shooting up with insulin at 15 1/2 and
having heart attacks."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And that went on all the way up to 22, but at 19 - how I
got through school?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I was the biggest cheat ever.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I picked the smartest, most
sensitive girl in the class."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I picked the most sensitive of the smartest girls
because not all of them were sensitive."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But back then, there were more sensitive
women because they weren't as injected as they are now and not as effeminitized
as they are now because of all these chemical inundations and the plastics that
make the opposite of one sex to another."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, I picked that smart girl who was
sensitive to sit next to and I copied her hieroglyphs because that is all it was
to me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If I tried to define the word 'the', I wouldn't know where to begin…
wouldn't have a clue of how to start."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I was completely communication-challenged.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, I copied the hieroglyphs... by the time I get teenage age, lets say 15
years old, I was copying so well, it looked like their handwriting."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So then the
teacher was saying 'Did you do this for him?'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",to the person I copied.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So then I
couldn't figure out what they were talking about."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I didn't understand why they
were getting reprimanded for helping me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was copying exactly - I was copying
so identically that it looked like somebody else's handwriting."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I never got
outside of that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Usually your autistic children have some kind of idiot-savant ability and mine
was math."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Have you ever seen the movie Rainman?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Well, that is what I could do."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Given a problem, I just wrote the answer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I had not a clue how I got it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I just
knew the answer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If I had a division problem, I didn't have to do the frame and
all of that division and subtraction that goes on in a normal problem."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I would
just write the answer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I got accused of cheating all the time with math and
finally in high school, they put me in a room with a test they had made up the
day before - and I did it very fast, came out in about 7 minutes and gave it to
them - you know 7 minutes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They accused me of breaking into the school and
finding the answers so they made another test that evening and they had me take
it the next day; I did the same thing with that one."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then I realized I was doing
it too fast - that's what I thought was the problem... So, the next morning, I
took my time - I took about 20 minutes to do it - it was about 45 minutes for
the average person to do - So, I handed it to them and they freaked out again."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So I was really confused; I didn't know what they were talking about.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So they
made up a test while I stayed in the room – they made up two of them - they
made up a test and they took it in to me and I did it in 5 minutes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then they
realized... then they thought all of my inability to get good grades - I got Cs
and Ds in everything because I was always copying."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","and I got bad grades only
because I refused to stand in and read in the room and participate because I was
unable to do that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I could not read - not a word - off the page. ...
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","not even by
sound...so I was constantly getting bad grades because of that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","My cheating was
good so I should have gotten good grades but because I couldn't communicate and
couldn't read in class I always got Cs and Ds."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So that is basically how I got through school and then when I graduated, from
high school, I was married."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I met a girl who was the second smartest girl in
school but she was a year ahead of me so she didn't have a clue what I was like,
but we got along tremendously; we didn't have to talk, we didn't have to
communicate but I had learned enough phrases by then - from Paul Newman, James
Dean, Elvis Presley who were the idols at that time so we watched movies We got
taken to the movies on Saturday so we saw all of them at the time – Zorro and
all of them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I emulated these people.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I learned to stand like Paul Newman and
act like him - and learn their phrases - to women so I'd hear those then
memorize them and learn them then repeat them to this new girl friend."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That was
appropriate; she was the first girl that I was really attracted to and that was
really attracted to me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But she was in a different grade so she wasn't in class
with me, she didn't have a clue who I was except in our personal relationships
and we didn't have to talk; she was one of those people that was an
intellectual, that preferred fewer words are better."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","say what's important and
that's it!"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And I had learned those words from Elvis Presley, Paul Newman and
stuff like that.... James Dean... from the movies - what to say to women - so
she was very enamored with me, liked that I was silent, most of the time, always
understood what I was feeling and what I was thinking, without having to talk."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She got pregnant; we got married, in February of my junior year When she
graduated, she was 6 months pregnant and hid it through the entire time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","... And then we started living together in the summer and I was working and
going to school at the same time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And she learned I was an idiot.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, everything
changed; she had the baby that September which was my first week as a senior in
high school ... and going to school, coming home ... they let me only do a half
a day at school because that was all the credits I had to achieve in order to
graduate."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I got home, I took care of the baby until my ex-wife got home from
work which was about 6:00."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then I went to work then when I got home, I would
have to take care of the baby because the baby cried all of the time and she
needed to sleep some."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was so wired on my routine that I didn't need to sleep
quite as much."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","At 8 years old I had had such chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia -
I told you, I was aching everywhere - couldn't lift this arm, couldn't walk."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If
I walked across this room and up the steps, I;d be wiped out for an hour."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So,
what I learned at 8 years old - I watched my parents drink coffee that morning
and I realized they got a buzz off of it and got lots of energy so I poured
myself a half a cup of coffee and they freaked - absolutely freaked."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The
hypocrisy in parents is absolutely tremendous ."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","95% of all that came out of my
parents mouth was a lie."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And autistic children know it more than other children
because as they learned to communicate, they learned to accept the lies."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But an
autistic child doesn't have that kind of ability to be ingrained."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That is why we
are so-called ‘unruly’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, half the time my parents spoke after I was 3 years old, I mistrusted them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Why? ...
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",because they took me to have my tonsils removed at three years old.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","There was nothing wrong with me in particular at that time - no cold, no flu -
but I was constantly getting tonsilitis - because of the poisons."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The tonsils
are the extension of the lymphatic system which cleans the body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So of course,
it is going to protect the brain from anything that enters through the mouth,
that could contaminate the brain and then the whole body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So the tonsils are
supposed to erupt to break down toxins so it can discard them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They [medicos]
would rather rip them out rather than deal with what causes them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The medical
profession is always dealing with symptoms rather than causes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I was constantly sick all the time, constantly weak and tired so at that 8
year old period I just decided to defy my parents and I would go in during the
middle of the night, usually about midnight when I knew my father was snoring so
loudly that no one could hear me; I would prance downstairs into the kitchen,
take that last - nobody drank that last 1/2 – ¾ - cup of coffee that was
sitting in the pot."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, I poured it into a jar, put a lid on it, put it under my
bed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","At that time, I was getting beat with a belt, even with a buckle and I
hated to get up, especially in winter, because I was so cold."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It would painful
in every joint so I did just not want to get out of bed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And so they hit me
until they hurt me to get out of bed - and if course it wouldn't hurt that bad."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It was - which pain is worse - so the pain was worse to stay in bed and get
beaten."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, at that 8 year old period, when I heard the first knock, ''rise and
shine' [deadpan] like the military it wasn't 'rise and shine' [cheerful] so I
would reach under the bed, get my coffee, drink it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Wow!
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was buzzed; I was hyperactive; they didn't understand that after than
one night during the 8 year old period because every night I got the coffee -
every night."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, nobody wanted to drink that last cup of stale coffee."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It wasn't
that stale to me!"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It worked!
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It was like a good medicine so I was wired.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","However, by the time I got to school, and an hour before lunch time, I wanted to
just sleep so I would sleep in class."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I saw other kids smoking and one of my
older brothers made me smoke one time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Although I coughed and coughed and puked
afterwards, it wired me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It gave me energy so I thought 'Ha!
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I can smoke at
recess time between classes'."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I went out into the little forested area
outside the school and had a couple of hits of the cigarette, put it in a little
can and then buried it under the pine needles."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I would go out there between
every class and take a few hits of the cigarette,."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, by the time I was 16
years old, I was smoking two packs of Lucky Strike non-filters a day and
drinking about 4 cups of coffee a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That kept me going.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, when I had the
child, I was buzzed even greater."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In fact I used to have to drink alcohol in
order to sleep, to bring me down."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So by the time I was 19 years old, I got
divorced."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Of course, it wasn't even a year later, divorced, I moved out to California
where I have an uncle who was matriculating for his doctorate in psychology at
UCLA."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He just said [to himself] I am going to encourage Aajonus to come out and
we see if we can take care of him at UCLA with the most modern technology
possible, and they are experimenting with everything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I moved out there and I
was making a lot of money at the time because my mother, after I graduated from
high school, took me to a new technical institute/university that taught
computer programming using unit wiring equipment."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In those days what is now a
chip this big used to fill up a room half this size, with discs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","We wrote
programs on punch cards and you put your punch card through and you wire your
particular unit for whatever kind of program , whatever activity that machine
would undergo and that goes into the computer too and then your information goes
through cards and sorts and analyzes it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So that is the way it was in those
days."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",My mother took me to that university just to see what would happen.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","There
was no comprehension, there was no dialogue; there was nothing but charts and
math – geometry – and it was easy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I whizzed right through it and I got the
highest grade of everybody."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",In fact I aced it – not a wrong answer on it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So
they took me into a conference room and realized that I was autistic; that I had
great learning challenges, communication challenges."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But they saw what I could
do - I could write a program in 2 hours that would take them 6 months to a year
to write - and flawlessly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So they farmed me out to Tyne Logistics Trucking
Company - the third largest trucking company in the world , IBM and Carte
Blanche corporation."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So I was making 80 grand a year as an idiot.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That was
pretty nice and pretty easy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, when I moved out to California, I
transferred/continued and the professors set that up."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They assigned a fellow
that had been out of college for about three years for learning disorder

this bone - this tibia - all the way down to the ankle.. buckled in the back,
open, and then this knee cap here was broken and shattered; this tendon was torn
down here, this tendon was torn up here and all of the top of the tibia and
femur had broken it off so all of these were broken particles, in my kneecap."

the level - your radiologist shoots the picture from here to here, from front

that, you shouldn't be in the practice."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now my uncle is
interpreting all this for me in ways that he could only understand me, that I
would understand."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I said absolutely NO to pulling my teeth, I wasn't going to
spend the last... - I had 4 teeth pulled when I was a child to put braces on me;
I suffered for months from that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So to pull all of them... the medical
profession is INSANE - absolutely insane."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I'm only going to live a few weeks and
they want to pull all of my teeth so I can bleed and suffer to death, and even
more."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It was to the point where I couldn't even sit like this, my back pain was
so bad."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I had to live on the floor like a worm.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had to crawl around on my
elbows."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I couldn't move the lower part of my body without excruciating back
pain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So here I was; I couldn't work any more, I couldn't concentrate any more;
I couldn't think."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",My talent for systems analysis was gone.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They ripped all the
furniture out of my house because I was defecating, vomiting and urinating all
over myself."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I refused to go to the hospice where people were dying and all I
could say was not-good things to them, because that was all that was trained
into me."

everybody unless you are intimate with them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The living room and dining room
were as long as this room right here - all wood floors."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I just crawled around
the floor and every time I would urinate and defecate and vomit on myself, I
would go to the next patch and stay there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It would take me about 2 - 3 days to
get around Some volunteers from the hospice came 2 - 3 days a week, cleaned
everything up, cleaned me up and made my food - and my food was powdered donuts
blended with RC Cola or Sprite so I could suck them out of a straw because I
couldn't chew."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And that was my diet and I loved powdered donuts.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I could live on powdered
donuts and cereals – the worst foods you could ever utilize because... why?:"

are allowed to use mineral oil to cook in."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Anything fried - cereals, french
fries , donuts, chips - all kinds of chips - fried in plastic oil."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That is oil
they hydrogenate to the point where it turns into plastic or liquid plastic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That is what I was eating.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That was my diet as soon as I got away from home.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That was all I lived on.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And my mother was no connoisseur, living on canned
food."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I grew up on canned foods; I will explain that later.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was not getting
any better; I was getting sicker and sicker."

year old African-American boy who was making about 80 - 90 grand a yearas a

kid came from Watts."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He turned me onto raw milk
and raw carrot juice and a little unheated honey,."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I drank those; the only
reason I drank them - and I didn't know what he was talking about - was because
they tasted good."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you have ever had chemo and radiation, and surgeries -
everything tasted like postage stamp glue or cardboard."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Nothing tasted good -
nothing was enjoyable."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Even Sprite didn't taste effervescent and good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But the
carrot juice and raw milk - absolutely delicious."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, I started consuming them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","About 10 - 12 days later I awoke and all of that
information I had heard - my brain had heard - it had stored it! …"

was, an adjective - all of this stuff."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I understood the parts of speech.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
understood communication."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I thought - ‘Ah, this is what it is all about’ so I called my uncle - who was
now a doctor in UCLA."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This carrot juice and
this raw milk that I have been drinking for the last 10 - 12 days."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It has
changed my life."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I can talk and I can communicate.

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I told him an incident that nobody
would think about, that nobody would tell anybody that happened on the day I
arrived in California He said ""Oh, my god, it is you!"""

said 'Well, it isn't that carrot juice and that raw milk”."

a difference."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He said 'It was all that therapy we did that finally worked' that
we did at UCLA."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",He was going to take all the credit.

knew what it felt like; I was autistic ,and autistics know truths when they
experience it."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
was evicted from the house because I had lost all of the money I had saved , and
got into an apartment, became an actor as you don't have to do much as an actor."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Of course, it was very difficult to memorize lines because I had only a
short-term memory for so long."

just keep them going for 24 hours to memorize lines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It was very difficult but
at least I was making money."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I had an apartment.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, gradually, gradually I got better."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I lived about a year and three months on the floor.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I tried to kill myself in a
bathtub drowning myself one time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I didn't want to deal with the pain, so I made
the water pretty hot, probably about 112 degrees.... and hadn't slept in three
days."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I could only sleep 10 minutes at a time, anyway."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I'd wake up in excruciating pain.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I got into this bathtub convinced I was
going to drown and I woke up 2 hours later in freezing cold water - buoyant as I
put a lot of Epsom salts in the water."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It had made me buoyant.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I awoke in
freezing cold water, cold as hell - but no back pain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, I thought 'Oh, my
god!'"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","so I drained some of the water out, made the water really hot again, and I
just stayed in the water."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was in the water 14, 16 hours a day because there
was no back pain in there - plus it made me feel better even when I got out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Even though I was back in pain again, it was not as much pain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I spent about a
year in that bath tub, getting better."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And then I went to work as an actor.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","and
gradually got better and better over time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","At 27 - I was supposed to die at age
21 - the chemotherapy had been just in my 22nd year."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then I stopped all of that,
so from the age of 22 - just starting my 22nd year - up to 27, I gradually got
better."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I mitigated the pain daily in my back to about 4 hours a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","For about
an hour and a half or two hours, I'd have to go into yoga postures - the plow
and the spinal twist - to get my back to stretch so that I wouldn't have that
pressure on the vertebrae, crunching the nerves in between."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, that gave me
great relief."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I went off on a bicycle because I knew I wasn't going to find
the answers in society because everybody is being pumped out in colleges with no
talent, just garbage information."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It used to be you would go into apprenticeship
for 12 to 15 years to become a master at anything."

information, especially about health."

in society so I went off on a bicycle."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I lived on a bicycle for almost three
years ... living off the land and with animals, creatures of all sorts."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Swimming
with alligators every day, doing everything that was not normal, to find the
answers to health."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had become vegetarian and fruitarian at that time because I
still thought that if I ate raw meat, I was going to get some kind of brain
parasite."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I started the raw food at that time when I started drinking carrot
juice and milk back in 1968."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But - the raw meat thing - I was so ingrained that it was dangerous that I just
wouldn't do it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I lived with 3 or 4 Indian tribes in the Americas in that 3 year
period."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They all told me to eat raw meat and I thought they were just trying to
kill the white boy for revenge for taking their land and wiping out their
tribes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Really, I thought that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I thought that was what they were doing.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And
then at the end of that, I was in Alaska in August - their hottest period."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It
was light 22 hours a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Gradually every night, it decreases by about 40
minutes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then, during the winter there is no sunshine except maybe 3-4 hours a
day, with indirect sunshine maybe three hours a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I wasn't there then.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I just
stayed until mid-September."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I saw them eating rotten meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I was aching in every joint.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The cancer of the
blood and bone that I had gotten from the radiation therapy was starting to come
back and surging again."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I stopped eating raw dairy, for the most part."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I thought
that ideal diet was the frutarian diet."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I went down to 98 pounds.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I am 182 right
now so you can imagine what I was at 98 pounds."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","96 I got down to for a short
period after a fast but was averaging around 98 pounds."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I saw them uncover this
rotten meat - I didn't know it was rotten meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They had these hides that they
unraveled And there was this molding mass in there just patinad black; white
molds, all this fungus all over it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It reeked like an abandoned 3 day old
slaughterhouse - so nasty smelling; it would give me the feeling of wanting to
vomit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When you pulled one of those out of the ground, there was a birdcall that
came up from downwind and the Eskimo wrapped the hide, buried it in the ground
and put dirt over it again."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",'Why did you do that?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He said 'Well,the birdcall
signified that they couldn't smell it half a mile downwind - so we have to make
sure it is that ripe before we eat it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The kids were around ready to eat it like
cotton candy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That was a cultural thing.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I waited around; I was on my way out that day on my bicycle I had to watch them
eat this stuff; I couldn't leave it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So I stayed about 3 more days.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They dug it
up and it turned out it was ripe enough."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If I got within 5 feet, I was
dry-heaving vomiting just from the odor."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",They all started eating it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They had an
area of ground a little bit bigger than this room."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",They were about a yard apart.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",They dug them all up.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",There were about 40.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","There were about three different
tribes that came together yearly to do this."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They all ate it; even the children
ate up to a pound in that 36 hour period."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Adults were eating like 3 pounds of
it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",They got me to eat a ping-pong ball sized amount.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had to plug my nose or I
was going to vomit or dry heave so they got some cotton balls and put musk oil
on them from the balls of a moose and shoved them up my nose."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","and I was able...
it just tasted like melted chocolate ."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It just dissolved in your mouth like
[inaudible lamb?]."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It had decomposed so much.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So the texture wasn't easy to eat
but it was easy to swallow quick but the odor was just horrific."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And everybody
was eating it - even the infants were crawling, eating this stuff."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Also, there
was still ice around and they still had igloos - some of them; some of them just
had tents but they didn't carry the tents in the winder."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They had 6 month old
babies - even 3 month old babies - crawling around on the ice floor."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","How many
parents would do that in this country. ""("
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","gasp) kid's going to get pneumonia;

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Can you imagine how hardy is the infants who can crawl
around naked on an ice floor?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Think about that - how hardy you would have to be.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That's what they are: raw meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That is all they ate: raw meat - some
blueberries if they could get them from the grizzly bears."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That's it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They
didn't eat vegetation Once in a while you might catch somebody chewing on a leaf
like a spearmint or peppermint leaf."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But that is it - no vegetables, Just raw
meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In Juneau and these places you have all these so called 'civilized' Eskimos
that eat everything cooked.,"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But out there where the Inuit live, it is still
raw; they know the value of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You can't cook and go out there and be in that
heavy weather and survive well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",They did not cook.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I ate that little ping-ball size amount.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was very wiped out and in pain - and
the sun was about to go down for its 3 hours and I got very cold; it was 50
degrees at that time – every joint in my body would ache."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had to get into my
sleeping bag for those few hours because it was getting down to 50 degrees
before the sun went down."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In the morning, it would take me about two hours with
the sun beating on the sleeping bag for me to be able to get out of the sleeping
bag - with a modicum of sanity and less pain - then I would lie in the sun for
45 minutes to where I had less pain and could be somewhat mobile."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And after that
rotten stuff that I ate, I was able to get out of the sleeping bag in 40 minutes
and only stayed in the sun directly naked for only 10 minutes and I was able to
function."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So I went back to the chief and said 'What was that mixture?'
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He said
it was minced caribou with seal blubber or whale blubber - one or the other."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then we bury it and let the micro-organisms break it down, pre-digest it so we
can use everything of it because in the winter, all of that is frozen So, we
collect a lot of it before we go into the winter."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I said no, no, no , no - meat doesn't get treated and black with white mold."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Oh, yes, it does!"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was under this medical shit; the only thing that I ever knew
that was fungus was gangrene, for human tissue so I thought 'This is the stuff
that I say - the fungi that I saw - in compost piles’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I was sure those were herbs and he is just telling me because he wants to
kill me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They accepted me into the tribe for a month at a time - all these
tribes and then I figured they were just suckering me up to kill me by giving me
raw meat and making me believe that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, I dismissed that and said they;'re not
going to help me so I got on my bike and was too weak and too much in pain so I
hopped on a freight train and bungee-corded my bike to the side - on the hammock
between the open doors - took trains down to southern California where I was
going to fast myself to death by just drinking water."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had picked an old Indian burial ground where I had been before at the foot of
some mountains and up in the foothills."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Some coyotes lived up in the canyon.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
did not know that they were up in this canyon."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Every night they would come and
wake me up; they would sound like a bunch of crazy people."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Did you ever see
'Cuckoo's Nest' [movie] ."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That is what they sounded like.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They would wake me up
every night around midnight and do their little thing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was in a pretty narrow
wash coming down where the water coming down off the mountain and dig a great
big crevice and I was right at the side of that where I build my campsite."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They
coyotes would slip around me and one would distract me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Of course it was dark,
there were just slight moves."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","After about the 10th or 11th night of this I got
so I could tell where they were."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you've ever fasted for from 25 - 45 days,
you know that you become very intuitive and psychic because you are leaving this
planet."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You are dropping your body.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was feeling that way already because I was
already down to 98 pounds - from 113 down to 98 points very quickly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had
started to gain some weight by drinking some milk back when I was up with the
Eskimos because they had some moose that they were milking."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","People say they
don't drink milk; they drink it when they can get it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I don't know how they
befriended the moose but they let the off-spring have as much as they wanted
then they took the rest."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",They gave it to me and to the babies.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They considered
me a baby because I was so skinny."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","After that, the coyotes killed the jack rabbit , for me, brought it to me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
hadn't eaten meat in almost 6 years at that point - a little over 6 years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
thought 'I'm doing to die'."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had become a vegetarian and vegan because I didn't
want to hurt animals."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So here was the Easter bunny on my feet, bleeding - and I
am going to pick it up and eat it?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And then this dialogue that my uncle had had
with my cousins and my brothers went through my head slightly verbatim - I was
probably about 10 years old."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Because I was so sickly, I never went hunting and
never played sports."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I stayed home to learn cooking and sewing and art.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And I
was a very good artist."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That went on for quite a while then I remembered the
dialogue that my uncle had had - what he said to his sons and my brothers was
that when you go hunting for a rabbit and kill it - you have to split it open
and cook it completely so the inside is dark - so there is no pink or white meat
at all ; it has got to be brown from being cooked - because there is a
micro-organism in a wild rabbit that will take over your digestive tract in like
48 hours and kill you in 48 hours."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I thought 'Oh, the coyotes are going to help
me die quickly’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, I thought 'I'll eat the rabbit and die quickly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I can
handle two days of pain easily."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I have handled years of pain.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Two days - no
problem."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I ate the rabbit; I ate about three pounds of it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It turned out to be
delicious."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","At first, I vomited ... Raw and yucky..So, I vomited the fist time
then I psyched myself out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The more I ate, the tastier it got until I was just
so full I couldn't move."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Those jackrabbits are about 7 1/2 pounds, adult ones."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This one was about a year old and pretty tender.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I ate about 3 pounds and by
the time I shared the rest of it, I went back to me campsite to die."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I knew I
was dying because I felt good."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",The only times I had ever felt good in my life were in near-death experiences.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I had died twice on an operating table; I hovered over the body and left it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The
farther away I got from it, the less pain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","By the time I got about 6 feet away,
there was no pain - it was all associated with the body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was feeling that way
as I was walking back to my campsite."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I thought I'll be dead in a few hours -
this is great!"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, I got back in my sleeping bag."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I woke the next morning and I
am still in my sleeping bag."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I hadn’t died.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I felt my pain - it wasn't as bad.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I was able to get out of my sleeping bag in 40 minutes again.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was able to lie
in the sun only 10 minutes and I was functioning again, like when I had the
rotten meats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was very delighted about that and thought 'I'm going to die
easily’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I had no severe pain.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I was still going into the plow position .
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
had no stomach problems at all."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Two days went by and I felt nothing.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I felt
stronger than I ever have in my life."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I had feelings of strength.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I felt
strength in my muscles for the first time in my life."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was almost 30 years
old - working on my 30th year at this time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Then 3 days went by - nothing.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I said 'OK - another lie by the medical profession’.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I'm going to get a brain
fluke from eating high meat- and I am going to die from rabbit flukes - microbes
or whatever it was was going to take over my intestines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Lies, lies, lies...

Those Indian tribes - all 4 of them - were not lying to me when they said 'eat
raw meat' so I got on my bicycle and went to ... because there were only rattle
shakes and scorpions and tarantulas and chipmunks and boy that certainly didn't
fill me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The snake did, but there are so hard to eat - they have so many ribs -
it is like eating ribs - tiny, tiny ribs It does not taste like chicken."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It
tastes like fish when the snake is raw."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, I got on my bicycle and went around
to the farms."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Around there was a farming community- and made deals to shovel
manure, to milk goats and cows, slaughter - to do whatever I had to do on the
farms in exchange for food."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And all I wanted was chickens, beef (unfrozen),
butter, cheese, all the dairy I could consume and eggs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That is what I lived
on - nothing but that - for 2 1/2 months."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I gained 55 pounds.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","For the first time
in my life, I was able to do physical work and enjoy it! ..."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","with literally no
pain!"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, I was ecstatic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","At that point after three months, I went back to L.A.
to spread the word 'raw meat is the answer’ and they all said ' You are going to
get a brain fluke and be an idiot."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I said 'I've been there and done that - all
my life - this is working.- it is actually working!’"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I can feel alive!
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I do
feel alive !"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And it is the first time in my life that I have ever felt this way.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I was very happy.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And I continued eating that way but only 3 days a week that I
ate raw meat and sustained on raw dairy and eggs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And then I got better and
better and got to the point where I could run up to 13 miles a day. ..."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The
first time in my life, I got athletic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But then, after about a year, I thought
'why am I doing this' - because I could but then I had no interest in spending
my time running around."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","My brain seemed to be doing better than my body so I
like to think a lot, read a lot, learn a lot and experiment - and do projects."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
invented stuff."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That is what I starting doing.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The poison mushroom (the deathcap) - in 1981 ... I ate enough to kill 15 people
my size - so I was in severe pain, cramps and spasms and epileptic fits."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
pulled out in ten weeks… I survived it; I knew what to do."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They say it
destroys your liver and your blood."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I forced myself to eat anywhere from a half
to a whole pound of raw butter daily even though it caused severe pain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I knew
the only way I was going to save that liver was to fill it with fat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I
survived it; here I am today."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I am working on my 67th year so I am way beyond dying I am doing pretty well.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
don't do anything that doesn't make sense and doesn't work."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This diet may not be
the most healing thing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","There is a lot of criticism for it but nobody can say
that they are alive after what I have been through,."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","All of the people who have
diagnosed with even 3 of the 4 cancers that I had - nobody has lived over three
months - three months after diagnosis."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I am 46 years beyond death by that death
sentence."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It works.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It works for everybody that does it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",We are going to take a break now.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",We are going to have a workshop after this.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That will run probably 5 1/2 hours then we will have a Q&A after that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then I
will do mini-consults where I look at the hands - not like the Chinese method
but my own method - where I can see how the red blood cells are, how well you
are manufacturing them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I can see what glands are working pretty well, and how
to help you to an extent."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Tomorrow and Monday I will be doing personal consults where I photograph the
irises."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In the irises you can see what is stored, where, in the body, what
toxins there are, where you are weak/damaged."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I can suggest things for you to
do."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I can suggest complete diets for that - everything to the detail, to the
minute of the day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",People who do those advance astoundingly in health.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Those
people who do their own thing always advance on this diet but at a nice pace."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If
you want to do it fast, I can help you get there faster."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In this detoxification section, I am going to give you the secrets for that so
you don't have to have my personal help to utilize those."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you know where your
problems are, I can help you with those areas and you can concentrate on those
areas and then you will move that much faster."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That is available for you at $385
for a personal consult."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Those who are having follow-ups for having seen me
before - that is $315."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The follow-up is about 50 minutes so put an hour slot in
there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I almost always allow 60 minutes with you anyway.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","For people for the
first time it is about an hour and five minutes, or an hour and ten or 15
minutes - right around there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","There is also the workshop I used to give is here
[/shop/primal-diet-workshop-digital-video-download/] that tells about how the
body works, tells about how the endocrine glands work - everything that I
won’t be going into much of at this workshop."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This will mainly be focused on
how your body detoxifies and how to repair it and heal it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In this, I tell you
how the diet works, how to food-combine, and that basically puts you in touch
with your body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The things I am going to talk to you about today will be about
how to achieve health much faster."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",and how to deal with your toxins.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The
Workshop

First I'm just going to run over how the body works, a little bit, a short
refresher course on that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Of course the body works in vitamins and enzymes and
proteins and carbohydrates and fats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Fats are the main nutrient needed in a
toxic world - and we are living in a very very toxic world."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",The reason for that is the body looks for fat to bind with poisons.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Wherever
fat is found in the body, the body will store its toxins."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So if you are skinny,
the body is going to find those fats inside cells instead of outside cells so it
is going to damage the cells."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Also if you are thin, its going to look for it in
two places where everybody has a lot of fat: in the brain/nervous system and in
the bone marrow."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The brain is pretty important and the bone marrow is where the
red and white blood cells divide and mature; once they mature, they enter the
blood stream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So your possible energy will be depleted by toxicity stored in the
main bone marrow."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So you do need excess fat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","A thin person is not a strong
person and is not a protected person."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Just to give you an idea, about ten years
ago someone came to me who was only about 18 to 20 pounds overweight and I did
his irises."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","His skin looked like it had years of drugs - very thick, very
calloused, very pock-marked - and the body throws 90 % of its toxins out the
skin normally."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you have waxy plastic fats from oils that you consume, it will
block that and your skin will not discharge it and then it will stay in the
body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And his eyes - the inside of his body looked like he was about 28 or 30 years
old yet he was in his mid-50s."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So I said 'Are you from this planet?'.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I said 'I
can see you've done drugs and alcohol for at least 25 years' and he said '30'."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And I said his skin had this kind of make-up inside - nobody can get over this
much damage without being tremendously fat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He said 'Oh, 3 months ago, before I
went on your diet, I was 300 pounds'."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So he took off 120 pounds.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, even bad
fat will protect you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","With no fat, the poisons are going to go into the cells
looking for the fat in the brain and bone marrow."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Since your blood stream is
made for one thing: creating energy in the body - not for the transport of
nutrients or anything else."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The red blood cells are to carry oxygen to the cells
so that the oxygenation process occurs so fats are transported into energy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","There is no burning; that is a fallacy created by government and medical
industry to confuse the thing - and the food industry that wants you to think
that cooking is how the body works inside."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",There is no burning.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","There is
transformation of energy only."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The carbons that are by-products look nothing
like the carbons from cooking just like the carbons that are produced by
breathing."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Why?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Because those cells are not in an animal.

death."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Why? ...
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","because you took the oil, the fat coating off the skin, you

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You still have them

them like you are in the other parts of your body heavy with chemicals - heavy
with shampoos and soaps that are deadly to bacteria."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So you are washing it off
now instead of the old way of the salmonella doing it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And that was a good
thing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Salmonella eating away was a good thing!
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now with people using soaps

first."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So you had better be on a perfect diet to even get it to the skin.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","How

don't have good fat there, you are in trouble."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",How does that work?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The lymphatic system - does everybody know what the
lymphatic system looks like."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It is another web network just like the blood and

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The nodes can be as small as a
bb, as large as a pellet and the glands can be as small as a tiny marble all the
way up to the size of the thumb... even larger if they are blown up with certain
kinds of toxicity."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So the lymphatic system takes waste.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It takes it inside the glands and inside
the nodes, makes a solvent or uses bacteria or fungus."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Mainly fungus doesn't
function in the lymphatic system - mainly bacteria."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The bacteria breaks down the
cell; the lymphatic system uses a lymph fluid to neutralize it which is high
concentrations of your alkalizing minerals like calcium, phosphorous, potassium
and magnesium - helps neutralize the acidity - and then makes it into a liquid
and dumps it in the connective tissue, mainly under the skin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then your body is

deficient or blocked, what is going to happen?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It is not going to neutralize
those poisons when it dumps into the connective tissue to be perspired to the
skin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So when it comes to the skin, it does tremendous damage to the skin such
as acne, rashes, hives."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",All of those are expressions... and burns.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You can even
have burns; when I show you the detoxification photographs - the different kinds

going to make it worse."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I will teach you how to get it through it and get
through it well so when you are repaired you are not worse than you were because
your body detoxifying itself is a good thing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You don't want to stop it[ you
want to help the body detox; you don't want to stop the process."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The more you
stop the process, the more industrial toxins remain in the body and then organs
shut down, body parts are impaired and don't function normally then when you get

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I will also give you a way, when we get into the remedy section
on how to get rid of all that, very easily."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Maybe not an easy activity but
pretty easy compared to getting old and sick and being bloated and fat in an
unhealthy fluid-fat way."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",The digestive tract starts in the mouth and goes down to the stomach.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","We form
hydrochloric acid in the stomach lining to break down proteins."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","We use enzymes;
we use digestive juices in the digestive tract to break down large particles of
food so that bacteria can digest your food."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When we eat, 90% of digestion - if
you are a moderate chewer - will be bacterial."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So the bacteria eat what we eat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They're feces, their urine, their sweat is our food."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Yuck!
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Get over it quick,
because that is what we eat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","We eat shit, piss and vomit and perspiration; that
is what we eat from the bacteria."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And when they finish eating that stuff, it is
all milk."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I don't care if you've eaten blackberries, blueberries, beets."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When
the bacteria finish digesting it, it is all milk."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That is absorbed into the
lacteal system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It is called lacteal because everything it absorbs from the
intestines is milk."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Lacteal means milk, in Latin and Greek."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So it is milk that
is digested from the bacteria."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Our digestive juices - we need more of them the
larger the particles of food."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, the old adage 'chew a lot, digest little' -
that is a good adage."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I used to say in my books I say you have to chew the meat
to swallow it; that is just for people to get it down."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you are going to do
that, grind it or pate it so you don't have to work hard."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I pate all my meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
no longer sit and chew it unless I am at a restaurant but then I will usually
order steak tartar which is finely chopped."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But once in a while I will order
steak because they won't make steak tartar for me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When I eat meat all pated, I
only sleep 3 1/2 hours a day and I am full of energy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When I chew meat and swallow it, I sleep an hour to an hour and a half more
daily because that is how much energy I am using for my bacteria to create in my
intestinal lining and stomach lining to create enzymes to break those larger
particles down to smaller molecules so that the bacteria can consume it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I am
utilizing more of my food and digesting it and utilizing it almost completely."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So I only have to sleep about 3 1/2 hours a day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I like that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you are a
hyperactive person and always anxious, don't chew, don't grind your food up,
make your body work hard to digest."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Utilize that energy if you are not using it
in physical activity."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I have no activity rings.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","My work is this... I am like
Cary Grant; this [finger exercise] is his exercise (does anybody remember that)
he said 'besides sex' and I am with that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Finger exercise and sex.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Those are the
only exercises that interest me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I need lots of energy to be able to work 21 1/2
hours a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, I make sure that everything is liquid when I eat it and the
meat is pated - so it makes it very easy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Q: Do you grind/pate meat in a blender?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Aajonus: No, in a food processor."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then all through the intestines, the bacteria
is breaking the food down into a milk substance."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When we get into the bowel it
is a little different."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Bowel starts here, goes from the ileocecal valve here, up
to the transverse colon, up transverse to here then the descending colon here to
the rectum."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now, why do we have a separate intestinal tract that is shorter?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Is
it because we make fecal matter there?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Well, we have fecal matter traveling
through."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Fecal matter is just waste product or undigested food.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But what happens
in the bowel is that we have a different set of bacteria mainly E. Coli."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","E. Coli
and the other related colonic bacteria break down the molecules of fat and
proteins into the finite molecule to feed the brain and nervous system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So
without a good functioning colon, our brain and nervous system don't get the
whole diet- the nutrients - that they need."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That's why if I ask somebody to do
suppositories of raw fats and/or egg in their colon squeeze it up in there
before they go to sleep at night - guess what."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","T heir brains and nervous systems
begin functioning very quickly very well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Depression disappears.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Some people
need to do that every other day, some people need to do it once a week, some
once a month."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It depends on how much good wholesome fat gets into your colon -
because your small intestine absorbs almost everything and it leaves very little
for the colon... because of our bad diets."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Even if your on my diet, which I
consider the perfect diet because - even in my cancer patients 98% are now
recovering."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Autistic children become functional and normal within 6 years - all
of them. …"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","one with this new avenue - not new now but was new back when I
wrote the book."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","One woman who implemented it changed the recovery rate of her
child - reduced it by four fifths; that child got well within one fifth the time
that it takes people who don't do that simple moldy raspberry once a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So the
bowel is very important to the brain and nervous system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I will tell you more about what to feed it and what fats to feed it, to inject
in your rectum before you go to sleep so that your E. Coli will have good fresh
fat- and not leftovers - to help you function mentally and emotionally much much
better in your life."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Also, some people unable to digest their fats here and in
the colon, they can."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So I had one person who only gained 38 pounds on the diet.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He was 5'8"" - almost 5'9"" and 112 pounds."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He gained 38 pounds on the diet which
just got him up to the low end; not fat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","To get him to do more I had him feed
himself in the but instead of just through here and it worked."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He was able to
gain more weight quicker."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He was a surfer and he'd go out surfing for 8 hours
and I'd tell everybody you have to eat all the time and if you are out there on
a surfboard for 8 hours in the California surf, you are not going to gain weight
unless you are eating constantly and not sleeping for the time that you are not
in the water surfing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But sticking up his butt helped a lot; it helped him gain
ten more pounds."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He had a lot more agility, was a much better surfer after he
started that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That was 2 1/2 years after he started on the diet.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you
understand your body, there is a lot that you can take care of quicker."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That is
what I am here to deliver to you today."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When you leave here today, if you know
how the body works from my other workshop, you will have everything you need to
be the healthiest person you want to be, that you can achieve in your lifetime."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You will keep it if you do it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It is just a matter of tenacity.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You have to be
willing to do it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Everybody has their levels that they are satisfied with their
health."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Some people don't want to give up donuts and RC Cola and want to have
cancer and die of cancer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I have no judgment about that whatsoever.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You can die
however... you can suffer throughout your life... you can do whatever you want."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I have been there and done that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I don't want it any more.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had my first cooked meat meal about 2 1/2 months ago; I had some broiled
chicken."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you are going to cook, the best way to cook is broiled over a flame
that isn't charcoal."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It had no lighter fluid in it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That was what was done.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It
was a tribal area in the Philippines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had a chicken leg = both the drum and
the thigh = and I had one little bit (it was a small chicken, probably about
this big) and I had one breast and one wing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I remember when I used to eat
cooked, I used to love chicken wings crisp and I would eat the bone and all;
well I did that this time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I had nightmares for six nights.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I haven't had
nightmares since I stopped eating cooked foods at 22 years old."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had six nights
of nightmares and I had to sleep 6 1/2 hours for the next three days."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So that 20
minutes of that cooked food robbed me of about 30 hours plus unhappy dreams and
not feeling rested and relaxed when I had awakened."

""Not worth it!"""

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I just did it as an
experiment."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I didn't think anything that bad was going to happen.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I thought
'maybe I will sleep a little bit more, maybe I will have a little bit of nausea'
but I had all of that plus nightmares."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It was not worth it to me.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","However you

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I will just tell you how to get as healthy as
I have learned."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Read a testimonial of the section below here

OK, so - when we defecate, when we urinate, none of that is supposed to be
toxic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",There are creatures in the world that live on shit.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Our whole
agricultural system is built on nitrogen."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Where do they get that nitrogen?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","From
slaughterhouses, collect the urine from dairy, from big old dairy houses, they
collect that urine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They sell it to Monsanto and Dow and all the chemical
industries that make that liquid nitrogen - processed cow pee, goat pee,
whatever kind of pee it is."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They buy all the pee they can get and they process
it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They process it in a way that destroys the bacteria in it so you are not
adding enzymes to your soil, you are only adding minerals and proteins t hat are
in that urine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So what happens is - it is good for one year.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It will fertilize your soil for
one year and one crop."

four years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I started using it on my plants about eighteen years ago.

just the urine."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was told if you dilute it, you need to
dilute it by 90% so it is one part urine to nine parts water."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When I did that,
it burned the roots."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Why?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Because it went into the soil very deep; it needs to
be broken down into topsoil first."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So all of that part of my garden was

an example."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I’ve got a, I just moved into a different place a year ago in
Malibu and they had 6 palms on the property and three of the palms were all
dried and their fronds were all wilted and turning brown and they’re about 52
feet high, three of them and three of them are about 45, 46 feet high and the
tallest ones the 55 foot maybe 58 feet high was tallest one had all this dry...
they were going to chop them down, cut them down."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I didn’t tell him what I was putting on the plants at night, on those palms at
night but I was dumping, I was collecting the urine for a month because it
breaks down better when you do that, the bacteria becomes more prominent, cause
they say urine is stale because of the high ammonia."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Well the ammonia breaks,
bacteria breaks down the ammonia so that the ammonia is not impediment."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When
they cook it they can break downtime ammonia that way when you process it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So that’s the way Dow, Monsanto does it, but it destroys the nutrients by the
processing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So anyway the ammonia is broken down by the bacteria that starts
growing in the urine, so I put that around the palms."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I just started a year ago.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I’m gone probably 6 months of the years.

palm."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","After the rains we had here, all of the leaves are bright because the
water, with rain with all of the bacteria help break in down in the soil already
predigested in the soil."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So you got to get
that lymphatic system moving."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","We’ve got to get the skin open and the
connective tissue unblocked."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",How do we do that?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Well we have to take a look at what’s blocking the system:
plastic molecules clustered together."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So as plastic oil that is in the
hydrogenated oils, that’s probably 90 percentage of all olive oils, are not
really olive oils."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They’re diluting them by up to 90 percent because there is
not enough olive groves in the world to feed everybody that wants olive oil."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Because now that people are aware of margarine and hydrogenated oils, they all
want olive oil and coconut oil, There are enough olive groves in the world to
feed maybe 30 million people, so now they are taking olive oil and they are
mixing it with either, not even an vegetable oil."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They are usually using mineral
oils or oils made from petroleum."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They clarify it and then hydrogenate it, so
you are eating hydrogenated oils even though you are eating olive oil not to eat
hydrogenated oils, plastic oils."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It’s a trap.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And if they allowed all of the
olive groves to flourish in Greece and Italy, you’d still only be producing
enough for 30 million people a year… not happening anymore."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And that would be
two quarts a year."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That’s not very much fat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","A lot of oil and what happens
when you put oil in the body anyway."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Most of it doesn’t digest.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It just passes
through because you are not built to eat vegetable oil."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You are not built to eat
olives."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Certain animals are.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",We are not.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Even your nuts.. we are not built to
eat nuts."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",We are not built to eat grains.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Birds and squirrels are.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They are
meant to eat that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",They have their bacteria for that… their enzymes for that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",We don’t have that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Everything in our body is geared towards the animal foods.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Now finally I got to prove that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In the mid 90’s, I had a friend I did a TV
show for - Merilu Henner."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She had a talk show and I was invited on it to be
somebody you are not to believe."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Four people on there and they had a profession
and you are supposed to pull out who had the false profession."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I was on there
as a nutritionist and most people thought I was the fraud."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Why would they think
that I was the fraud?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Because I played my act the role a little obnoxious and
somebody that wouldn’t be considered a doctor."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That’s part of the acting
thing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, but I had to answer the questions honestly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You are not allowed to
lie."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So this college girl says I am going to expose you right away.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I’m at
UCLA."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I’m a third year nutritional student at UCLA.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","How many proteins are
there?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And I said ‘there are 22, eight essential."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Do you want me to name
them?’"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",She fell back in her chair. ‘
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I still don’t believe you though’
she said."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So they didn’t get the guy.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",The guy who had the real profession was a forensic mortician.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I got buddy
buddy; then I said ‘so listen."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I need some bodies, elderly people who have
died from natural causes, no disease."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I don’t want medication in them.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I need
access to their gall bladders, their livers, their stomachs, their intestines,
and their rectum’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And he said ‘I could do that; I don’t know if I can do
it all at one time because I get access to bodies and I do work for the Los
Angeles police department and the city for autopsies on questionable deaths or
something to prove their dead was natural’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So over a 2 year period, it was
not quite two years, I had access to 22 bodies and I picked 8 that looked like
they hadn’t had not a lot of disease in them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And I had the salivary glands
and I took the salivary juices and they hadn’t been dead over 24 hours."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I took all of their digestive fluids in every organ that I could of the
digestive tract and I had all of these different foods set up, category of nuts,
category of vegetables, category of fruits, category of dairy, category of
meats, and including glands in that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had over 22 items and I put and broke
them up into little parts and I put salivary from 8 people on each one so it was
a lot of work and a lot of laboratory I had to use, but not all at one time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
had up to 3 corpses at a time, and the others were singular so only one time did
I have a huge array of tables set up like this for them in the laboratory."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The
digestive juices - all of them - and each of them only actually did any kind of
proper breakdown on the dairy, the meats and the eggs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In the nuts barely
etched, 6 to 8 percent."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",In the vegetation 2 to 3 percent.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","One did as much as 4
percent but it averaged about 3 to 4 percent for vegetation."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That is not a good
result."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Our saliva, the bacteria in the saliva, and the enzymes, the bacteria that
makes up the enzymes all through the digestive tract handles animal products
properly, only."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So we are are not vegetarians or fruitarians.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And look at your
primates who are fruitarians."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Who wants to act like a monkey, masturbate all day
long and screech and yelp and go crazy?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That’s what happens when they eat all
that sugar."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And you heard of the killer monkeys in Africa.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",What do they do?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Every year or once a twice a year, they let the figs and bananas ferment."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","For 24
hours they will eat that, gorge themselves with it, the alcohol just blocks
their brain out and then they will go to the jungle and kill everything,
elephants, monkeys, insects."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They will destroy everything in their path without
even eating them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They just kill and they will go on for sometimes for 20 miles
doing this at a wide scope of 300 meters."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That’s you know, 3 football field
wide."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And just destroy everything for 22 miles.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Can you imagine that?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That’s
because of all the sugar and the alcohol that they eat that causes that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you
were to deprive a monkey and I’ve done it, of all fruits and only let them
have meats, that monkey is as calm as a jay bird."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Jay birds are about the only
ones that are calm birds that I know."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Birds are going around like this because
of all the carbohydrates that they eat too."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Birds are very flippity.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So you have to look at what things are doing.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Look at children.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","My publisher
just had his first baby."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He is 42 years old, just has his first baby."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She is now
9 months old and I went over there for Fathers Day because I am considered the
father of the family."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And he doesn’t like his farther.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","His father was like my
father."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He does even talk to his father and I went over there and the child
freaked out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I mean when he saw me or anybody else that came just freaked out
stared and cry and cry and cry."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I said did you feed her fruit today?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And Paul
says ‘fed her watermelon all day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I said kept saying don’t do it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Don’t do
it’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And you know she doesn’t listen to him because he is in the movie
industry and a publisher, not a nutritionist ."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She listens to me so that had to
come for me and I said ‘you watch."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You don’t do this for two weeks.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You do
it to her again and you will see she will react like this again’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In the Masai
tribe, it is illegal to feed anybody under 16 fruit for that very reason…
because of the high sugar activity that will occur in the brain and nervous
system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","What it does is that the myelin is the coating on the sheaths of all nerve
sheaths."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That’s 60 to 80 percent fat just like the brain and when the impulses
come in through that myelin, that myelin and its fat absorbs a lot of those
impulses so lets say a prick of a pin is 200,000 impulses."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","By the time it
reaches the brain, it is filtered down to 2 to 3 thousand impulses."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That is all
the body has to register."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Can you imagine the prick that you feel magnified by
50,000 times."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That little prick becomes a stab in your liver, so that’s what
happens with the child."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You rob the myelin from their fat and then their
information can’t get buffered so that anything new that comes into their
environment, everything is overwhelming - and that’s what fruit does in the
system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That’s why I say in my books and in my DVD set, fat has to go with
every fruit that you eat and it has to be enough fat to buffer and slow down
that sugar reaction so your body is not robbing it from the brain and myelin for
the sheaths of the nerves."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So remember that fat is ultra, ultra important and I
see some, a few thin people here."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It is not a good thing.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Not a good thing to be
thin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You always have more fat to be protected and buffered and I will give you
an example of a situation, several situations ,where people were very happy they
were fat when they had problems when they suffered toxicity and some that were
thin at the when they suffered toxicity and I will show you the difference when
we see the photos."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I will also show you two laboratory investigations done at the University of
Calgary, in Canada, on mercury."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",@Here and @here.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This is just the mercury used in dental amalgams and how they outgas and make a
body very toxic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That is outgassing and crystallization of mercury.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Can you
imagine the damage if you take that information and then you look at what it
does when you inject into the body in a vaccine in a child and what it going to
do to the system?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You will really get my point.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","People don’t see the really
put it together until they see this two videos that display exactly what happens
with toxic mercury in the neurological system, and the rest of the body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It
doesn’t just damage the neurons and the nerves; it damages a lot of organs in
the body including the liver and kidneys."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So fat is so, so important."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you are
ill get fat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Do not stay thin.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Get fat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I’m on my thin side right now.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Three
months ago I had a 47 inch waist."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Right now I am a 34 inch waist.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So you can
imagine how big I was."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had to wear my pants down here around the tummy for the
first time in my life."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I went from a 31 inch waist to a 37, sometimes a 38."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
had three wardrobes to handle that because I have been so poisoned in my life
and I am still poisoned."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And I’ll tell you about one incident a little later.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I like to maintain a
lot of fat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I always feel better.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I knew I was going to South Africa, and then
Australia and then Asia and I just can’t get all the fat that I want, the
butter and cream that I want, so I had to live on a leaner diet."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I got really
fat this time so that by the time I got back I wouldn’t be thin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I am
working my way back up now."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",l I got up to 47 inch waist this last time.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That was
huge compared to where I had been before but it also protected me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had no
problems when detoxifying."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","There is an episode that I will tell you about when I
get into the pictures."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So fat, fat, fat, fat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I can’t say enough good about
fat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now the only problem is the fat that feeds the brain and nervous system
mostly and properly and thoroughly is raw cream, and the raw cream that is in
milk is not quite enough even when full fat cream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You still need a little bit
more every day than just what is in the milk."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The problem is that raw cream is
the hardest fat to digest of all of your fats, animal fats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Oils really
shouldn’t be called fats although they are."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They are nearly impossible to
digest properly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But they will function to do certain things in the body… like
olive oil, the truly cold pressed flax oil, coconut oil."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","None of them digest
fully but they will help the body build viruses, solvents to clean certain areas
of the body, parts of the body and certain elements have of the body that you
can’t do with the normal animal fats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Even the fats in an egg yolk are very,
very easy to digest."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The body can digest that fat in about 37 minutes, 27 to 37
minutes, egg yolk… a whole egg in that much time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Every other food takes 6 to -
every other liquid food like milk takes - 6 to 10 hours to digest."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Meat takes
19 to 24 hours to digest."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Egg 27 to 37 minutes, depending on how you eat it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And
the raw cream though can pass through the body without digestion if you eat it
with raw meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It will coat the raw meat and then it will come out kind of
pearlish and roughly 30 percent of that cream will not be digested."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",What a waste.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And almost 50 percent of the meat will not be digested properly.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, great loss."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So if you want to have cream with meat it has to be sour cream.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",The bacteria already has to have predigested the cream.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That’s what sour cream
is, predigested cream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Just remember any raw food does not putrefy.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It only only
sours."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It predigests from the bacteria within it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Let me give you an example.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",There is a tribe in Africa 5 years ago that was deprived of its hunting rights.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And it was a tribe that lived on hunting, entirely ate meats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This particular
country made all of their land natural animal reserves."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Parks for what?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","For
hunters that would spend spend 30,000 dollars for a 3 day hunting trip."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So this
tribe has now to go living on grains, agriculture and they were a nomadic tribe."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This documentary fellow who made that film called the Last Dance, about the last
hunt the day after that hunt or the week after that hunt nobody could hunt any
more."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So there’s three hunters who go out hunting an antelope and he follows
the hunt."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Now these are tribes that actually run down the antelope.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Wear the
antelope out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Can you imagine what a hunt that is?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So they will go and go until
that antelope can’t go anymore."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",But they do.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",They do.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So you are watching
them; the third day they reach this rotten animal that’s been rotting for at
least 10 days."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You could smell it for a half a mile away.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That to them was good.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Ahh.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You follow the trail to the animal, rotten animal, chase the vultures away
and all the other birds that eat dead creatures, and the other animals around,
hyenas."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They chase all those animals away and they sit there and eat this rotten
meat raw."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",All the other meat they cook.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",But the rotten meat they eat raw.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They
said in their language that was translated: We eat this because this is the best
food in the world."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","With this we will outrun the antelope tomorrow and all during
the night they keep going."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",They rarely stop.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They camp a little bit for a few
hours only to eat and they just sat there for about an hour."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They ate this
rotten stinky animal full of maggots and they had vultures and crows and you
name it those birds were there eating it and these guys were eating it and
they’re so invigorated and you see the eyes get bigger and they get stronger."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You are just watching this happening on the film.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And then the next day - that
morning - they got that animal cornered and you see the antelope [sound of hard
breathing, gasping]."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It can barely walk.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So they kill it and take it back to the
tribe."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The guy they call the runner actually just ran him down got so much
energy from that rotten meat that he was able to run that animal down until it
could not run any more."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I mean run not just run at a jogging pace; this was a
hard run, not a sprint but a very hard run, until that antelope could not move
one more leg, huffed and puffed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So rotten, any meat, any animal food that is
rotten is only predigested by that natural bacteria in the animal, so it is
healthy to eat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Sour cream can be eaten with meat but no other cream should be
eaten with meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Butter is the best thing to eat with meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That way you don’t
transform your meat it into a fuel because the body will take meat more often
than not and turn it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Yes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Inaudible question

Aajonus: Well it is going to go into rigor mortis at that point, so you are
going to have to beat the meat, tenderize it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Usually with the cover on it, the
hide on it, it goes into rigor mortis, and it doesn’t break down well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If an
animal killed it, he would rip it open Then all the oxygen goes in the aerobic
bacteria allows for the breakdown."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When an animal hide is contained, it goes
into rigor mortis."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It is very difficult to eat, because what it does - it
becomes beef jerky."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I have eaten road kill many times, absolutely."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If I am in a
safe forest area where I know the animal hasn’t gone out and eaten in
somebody’s back yard, eaten some toxic food."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Inaudible question

Aajonus: I hit one in Malibu one time and I wouldn’t eat it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It lived in the
mountains of Los Angeles... ...airplanes going over dumping their benzene and
all that stuff... no way am I am going to eat an animal out of the forest in Los
Angeles."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Inaudible question

Aajonus: Yeah, it will still will coat some of that meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Probably if you had a
quarter of a teaspoon it wouldn’t make any difference but I’ve eaten up to
and I’ve checked the feces of people that have eaten up to 3 ounces of sour
cream with 8 ounces of raw meat, both digested fine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But I have measured up to a
tablespoon [of regular dairy cream] with 8 ounces [of meat]; most of the cream
was not digested, probably 3/4 of that was not digested, and about one third of
the meat was not digested just from 1 tablespoon of cream, because it coats it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Inaudible question

Aajonus: I haven’t tried that but probably would be less effective in
preventing the meat from digestion, but you have to remember the meat moves very
slowly through the system, very slowly, the slowest thing to move through the
system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It digests the slowest.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, that’s the problem there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The cream has a
tendency to catch up with the meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I would say maybe an hour after it
probably would be OK."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now I’ll drink 2 ounces of milk with the meat meal right
after a meat meal, 10 minutes after a meat meal, 20 minutes after a meat meal,
no problem."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",But straight cream is different unless it’s sour cream.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Question: what about milk with a meat meal?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Aajonus: Not a good idea You have to realize meat needs heavy acidity and all
of the alkalizing minerals especially the calcium in the milk are going to
neutralize some of that acidity."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Probably if your meat was all ground, it would
probably be no problem because you are just depending on bacteria anyway."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But
when you have to build acidic digestive juices like hydrochloric acid, milk
neutralizes it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So it is better not to have but 2 ounces after a meat meal and
none with, unless you’re a big guy and eating a whole pound at a time, let’s
say you are eating 16 ounces, you could probably get away with a half a cup with
a meat meal."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Question: I have been washing the meat down with milk.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Aajonus: Ah.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Well then if you do that, then pate the meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Question: Less chewing.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Aajonus: Pate the meat and then it won’t be a problem.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Inaudible question

Aajonus: Well, You know I found that it didn’t work very well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","People had a
lot of diarrhea from that for some reason, loose bowels."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So now I’ve done that
for people whom I had to feed through the stomach, because they had a tube in
their stomach, people came to me very late in their cancer process whatever it
was."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They had all kinds of organs removed and they had the tube down there in
their stomach and oxygen down their throat, but I have made pate like that,
blended milk with the meat to get it into the feeding tube, and that was good as
long as they were unconscious or feeding that way but as soon as they got out of
it then they had looser bowel movement, so it is something if your are really
sick it is probably OK but the best is a egg when you are in a tight situation
like that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Question: What about butter?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Aajonus: No.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Butter and honey is good for comas and also good for everything,
but if you want somebody to recover fast, raw eggs is the key, like I said in
the recipe book, I had a doctor an MD call me on a Thursday night about 9:30 my
time and she was from Maine and it must of been 12:30 her time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She said I have
an emphysemic patient who was diagnosed 7 years ago with emphysema."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She has been
bed ridden and on machines for the past two years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",What should I do?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She is
gonna die this weekend."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",What should I do?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Well you calling me a little late
aren’t you?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And she says well I’m an medical doctor and a medical doctor is
not allowed to suggest anything alternative except what’s in the books that
the pharmaceutical houses write, procedural manuals."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Merck’s is this thick.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",The word cure does not exist in it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The word heal is mentioned 53 times, only in
cuts bruises and surgery."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Talking about healing a wound.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But the word cure does
not occur in the entire manual."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They want you to believe that there is no such
thing as a cure."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They want you to be on medication and medical treatments for
the rest of your life."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They’re a business, that’s what they want, so I said ‘well that’s your
conscience’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",We can only use the pharmaceutical methods.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","We can only recommend
those up for minimum of 10 years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","We have to try those, if they fail after 10
years we can suggest alternatives, or if the patient’s on her death bed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This
woman is on her death bed and I am able to seek other advice and give her other
alternative advice."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I said ‘that’s your conscience’.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But she said I have
my family and everybody to take care of."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I said that’s still your conscience.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I said, but it’s nice that you are calling now."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But the only thing that I can
recommend is get 10 to 15 dozen raw eggs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You put them on her bedside table and
tell her to eat as many as she wants."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",There is no limit.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So this is on a Thursday, her Friday morning."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So Monday I get a call from this
raspy voice women. ‘"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I’m out of bed.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It worked.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",What else should I do?’
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
said ‘well who are you?’. ‘"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Well, my doctor called you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was... I have
been."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",diagnosed with emphysema.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I have been bed ridden for almost two years on
machines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I ate the eggs you suggested.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I’m out of bed and off the machine.’
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This is Monday morning.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I said, ‘well how many eggs did it take?’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She
says, ‘I ate 66 eggs.’"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I said ‘how and when?’.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She says ‘I ate 33 on
Saturday and 33 on Sunday’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","After the first two, I had no problem."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They’re
delicious."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So I ate 66.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",What else should I do?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I said keep up with the eggs.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Keep downing the eggs and when you feel you can digest meat you get some
unheated honey, unsalted raw butter and put those at about 6 to 1 butter, 1
honey, and eat that mixture and eat meat when you can and some raw dairy when
you can but right now you need to stick with the eggs and do that.’"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That was about 12 years ago.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I still get a call from her once every three years
just to let me know she is doing great and she was supposed to die that weekend."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Only eggs can can do that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I’ve tried other things and only eggs can do that
because eggs can digest in 27 minutes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Pretty remarkable, and it has every
nutrient in the world."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It is the only food that has every nutrient in the world.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The only thing that I have found that eggs cannot do is help the body reproduce
cells quicker."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That takes raw meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It provides every nutrient that is possible.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So eating the two together, or not at the same meal - you can - but eating those
two foods is going to progress you towards strength and health and body organ
function much quicker than any other food will."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Most of the other foods that I
recommend are fruits with fats for detoxification, cleaning the body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In the We
Want To Live book in the remedy section, I cover the foods for particular
symptoms or particular diseases."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you have those symptoms or have been
diagnosed with that disease and you truly have those symptoms, eat that food,
eat the fruit with the fats to help clean that system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you have a problem in any area it is because industrial toxins, industrial
chemicals have entered that body and stored at a point where they are damaging
cells in that area."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So you need to clean those out of the system if you want to
function properly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","All infection, all disease is toxicity trying to be removed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So you don’t stop the disease, you the stop what made the disease and you
clean what made the disease."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That’s the whole point.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The pharmaceutical
medical industry and I group them as one because they are tight as a fist
together."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The medical profession is like the fingers and the pharmaceutical
profession is the palm The strength is all here, and the little minions of that
industry are your doctors, and all they have to do is make money and that is
what they are geared for to keep you on medication, one medication takes care of
the side effects of another and on and on."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When my parents died my father was
taking about 63 medications a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","My mother was taking somewhere around 86
medications a day, pills a day not medication but pills, lets say they were
taking probably 20 different medications that made up those pills."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",For what?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Its
ridiculous."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",My parents started really declining in their early sixties.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And I
got them to eat raw eggs with raw fresh orange juice and honey and some raw
cream, and I got them to do that for breakfast."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","My father had his toast of
coarse with It."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","For lunch they had a salad with good cold pressed olive oil and
grated raw cheese over it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They wouldn’t eat raw meat, not even raw fish but
they ate a lighter, more lightly cooked and they had raw milk and they had
cheese with that meal, and a small salad to neutralized some of the over acidity
from the cooked meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They got better and then in about their mid 80s, their mid
80’’s, they decided no, we are pretty good we’re doing fine we gonna stop
this diet and go back to our old ways so that we don’t have to live so long."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
said ‘Hello!!!"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So that we don’t have to live so long?’
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","We lived a good
life and we have enjoyed it, so we thought that if we eat this food, you know we
will take longer to deteriorate."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","We don’t want to deteriorate over a long
period of time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I said that makes no sense.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You’re going to get less ill, you
may just go to sleep and die in your sleep with out any disease."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Well, we
don’t want to take that chance."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So they stopped eating all the raw foods.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","My

could even sit up even though he couldn’t control his left hand and leg."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You
could see there was improvement and I got somebody to bring him the milk shakes
every day but he wouldn’t drink them, only when I brought them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It didn’t
make any sense but it’s not my life."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I can’t dictate what my parents do.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Even though it made no sense it made sense to them.

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That’s the real
stopper."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","How much mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, detergent, ether you have
stored in combinations in your tissues."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I’m not going to go over any more of that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","To talk about, what time is it?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I’m 45 minutes up.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Oh, I’m talking a little fast aren’t I?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Getting a
little ahead of myself."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Everybody following while I’m going too fast?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",OK.

very tiny but they cluster together."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They block pores, they block circulation,
they block circulation even to the lymphatic system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Like I say all those people

more."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",How can we move it out of the body?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This
diet won’t do it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Let me give you an example.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","A dear friend back here has a
lipoma [tumor] on his neck."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Show everybody.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I'm going to use you as a
demonstration."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Now he does the diet.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But, see the size of that lipoma [tumor]?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It is not moving because that’s plastic.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",He can’t get rid of it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He says
I’m doing the diet 100 %, I don’t vary it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I am strict with it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I’m
tenacious."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I said, but how many times have I told you that you have to put heat
on it?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Its like a solid substance that has to reach 105 degrees before it turns
liquid again."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So how many people are going to go into a 105 fever every day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Nobody.

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It will stay in the body your entire life unless you get a hot tub and you sit
in that hot tub 90 minutes every day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You will melt it and move it out of the
system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you are just trying to get rid of the waste that is already under the
skin, that’s about 40 minutes a day and you can get rid of that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But to get
deep into the lymphatic system, into those glands and nodes, you have got to be
in there 90 minutes a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you have a hot tub, it is easy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You can go to
sleep… after you are used to hot hot water, being in it for a length of time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You get used to it, do your first 90 minutes of sleep in the tub."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Get out and go
to bed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now I have been telling people this for how many years, and telling
people to do it who come here."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Let me give you one example right here in this
room."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","All these years I’ve been telling people to do it, and tell them what
you did."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Question: I’ve done the baths for 7 days straight and it was really
tough the first day or two but I have noticed probably more energy the last
seven days than I have in the last several years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","My face is cleared up more in
7 days than it has been my whole life."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","My brain is a lot clearer and I don’t
require as much sleep."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Aajonus: And look at his red blood.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","See how pink his
coloring is."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I’ve known him all these years and he has been mostly coloring
like you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Now look at him.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Just seven days.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Question: Will saunas do the same?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Aajonus: No, sauna is too hot."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It will damage your mucus membranes, your eyes,
your ears, your lungs your bronchials."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You can’t turn it down to 110.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And also
when you have air heat you got a buffer of about 12 inches."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That means that you
will cool the heat down to a certain temperature."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When you have water you only
have an inch, less than an inch buffer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Question: How much of your body do you
have to get in the water?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Aajonus: As much as you can get.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Wherever you have the
worst problem, but people like you as thin as you are."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You do not take the 90
minute baths, you only take the 40 minute bath."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You have to wait until you gain
another 25 pounds to do that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","35, 40 minutes is OK."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Question: What about toxins
in the water?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Aajonus.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I got it in the book under health methodologies.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It tells
about lymphatic baths, it tells to put milk, vinegar, clay, sea salt, Epsom
salts, things like that in your bath and it tells you how much to neutralize."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In
the hot tub you have a filter on it which will take out the toxins, a sand
filter; you put coconut cream in it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That’s fine; it won’t block the sand.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You let the algae grow on the sides but that water will stay crystal-clear with
sand."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It will let the algae grow on the sides.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And the algae eats what?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Rock.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So
what does it do?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It pulls metal out of you as long as you are sitting on the
algae."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So in my hot tub I let the strands of algae get this long before I
cultivate them, before I take it out out and feed it to my garden and my garden
loves it because algae eats rock, they eat metal."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So it pulls it right out of
the body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","People say ‘well then I should eat algae and chlorella and spirulina
and stuff like that’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Well when I’ve done fecal matter tests with people
that have eaten that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",They digest 2 percent.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",What a waste.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Algae is a plant.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","We
are not herbivores."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",We do not digest plants.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Certain fish are meant to eat it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",We are not.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","However in the chlorella that I have tested, 8 percent of it is
digestible."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So if you are going to use chlorella, use just an eighth of a
teaspoon in one of your vegetable juices and let it sit in there just to start
hydrating again."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You can’t digest almost anything that is dry and dehydrated.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You are not a vegetarian in the first place.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Yes?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Inaudible question Aajonus:
Well it has to be alive to do that and it won’t be alive in the digestive
tract that’s 24 hours."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Inaudible question Aajonus: You want to starve it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Well, in the tests that I have done 92 percent of it came out with no extra
metal attached."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The body even in the hardest exercise never gets over a 100.1
degrees."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Gotta reach 105.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Like I said in an airspace you get a 12 inch buffer.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",If it is 105 there it is only going to reach 100 degrees on your skin.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You will
never find skin over 100.1 degrees."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Any kind of an exercise in a 105 degree
room."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Even a 110 degree room.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The lungs will get exasperated more than anything
in a room like that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And then you are going to wear down just from that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Oxygen
doesn’t transform easily in that kind of heat unless you are very used to it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So a hot tub is best.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If your are in a bath tub you are going have to let some
of that water out every 20 minutes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So what I do: I put in scalding hot water
half way."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Let that sit for 10 to 12 minutes to heat the whole bath tub.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The I
put lukewarm water in to fill it up to the point where I get in there so it does
not overflow."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And I... my tub when I had a tub at home... I put a rubber stopper
in with a cut at the top so that the water went all the way up not at the
bottom."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It gave me another 3 1/2inches of water level so I can get farther into
the water Then I put the ingredients in when it is 115 degrees, 114 degrees: the
milk, the vinegar, the sea salt or Epsom salts."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Coconut cream I like because it
makes the skin lubricated and doesn’t dry it, and I will let that sit in the
water 7 to 10 minutes, then I get in."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",By the time I get in it’s 110 degrees.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","110 degrees is when the highest point you will get the skin without damaging the
bacteria and the enzymes in the skin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Up to 111 starts doing damage to the skin
in and around the skin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So 110 is the top.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had many people for example, I had
a fellow who was about 62 years old, been on the diet since he was 57, and I
kept telling him, ‘you gotta do the hot baths, you gotta do the hot baths’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He went on the diet because he was diagnosed with thyroid failure and prostate
cancer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So he went to the doctor, got a prescription, was standing in line and
he watched all these people living on their medications."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He says ‘I am not
doing this’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So he went home.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He got a call from this young architect friend
of the family who said ‘thank you for that book."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That was really a great book!
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",How is the diet working for you?’
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",He said ‘what are you talking about?’.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He
said ‘you sent me a book’. ‘"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I sent you an architectural book’.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",he said.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","‘No, you sent me two of them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In the package was this book on diet which was
called We Want To Live by this guy named Aajonus Vonderplanitz, and you sent me
the architectural book’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He said ‘it is so great... I changed my whole life
with this diet in just three months’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",He said ‘well send me back the book.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
didn’t mean to send that’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He says, ‘no, I got it marked up; you’ve got
to get your own’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So he got the book, went on the diet and this guy you know
he’s retired multi, multi millionaire."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But he retired because he could work
any more."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He was just a vegetable; all he could do is eat sleep and watch TV –
a couch potato."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So here at 62 years old I get him to start doing the baths and
he wants, most people like to go overboard, so in my book it said 101 degrees,
so that’s it was supposed to say but it got inverted so it said 110 degrees in
the book and it was supposed to day 101, because I hadn’t experimented with
enough to tell people to go up to 110 degrees."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was going to work my way into
it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",The highest temperature for an extended period.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I get a call from him
three months later and he said, ‘I can do nothing after I get out of the tub
the next day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","All I feel like doing is eating and sleeping and watching TV,
nothing is changed’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I said ‘well, how how are you doing the diet?’"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And he
went over it. ‘"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That’s pretty good; not exactly as I stipulated, that’s
good, and it shouldn’t cause you any problems."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Maybe take things a little
slower’ and I said and ‘how are you doing the baths?’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He says ‘I do
them every day’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And I said and how much time?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He says ‘90 minutes a day,
sometimes two hours a day’. ‘"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And what’s the temperature?’
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And he said

Aajonus: They said that most of the toxicity from mercury comes from dental
fillings."

far away it is from the actual neurons and the vaporized mercury is… those
little beads you see are actually traveling in the medium over here to destroy

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They have
11 different names for mercury that they use in vaccines – as an antiseptic,
as a preservative… and each one of them has a different name."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So they have
eliminated the thimerosal use but still they are using mercury under a different
name."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So they’ve gone from 76 quadrillion molecules of mercury per vaccine to
56 quadrillion molecules of mercury per vaccine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It takes from 50 to 200
molecules of fat to remove one molecule of mercury safely."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you have –
let’s say 20 vaccines in your lifetime – that is 20 times 76 quadrillion
molecules of mercury."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","How many lifetimes will it take you to get all the mercury
safely out of the body?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That is how bad it is.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But I’ve got new ways of
getting things out and I’m going to discuss those."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Now we are going to talk a little bit about detoxification through the skin.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","About 3 years ago April, I was abducted in a hotel room in the Philippines and
injected with three hypodermics and this was in 2009 when I had done a radio
show in February right before the swine flu was manifest in April."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I started the
show about other matters but it got into the swine flu."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Well, I had been
involved in the swine flu hoax fiasco of 1976."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was 39 years old; I had just
gotten back, eating all the raw meats, back into Los Angeles and they were
throwing out the swine flu hoax thing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had done a radio show around then with
Ida Honorof who was a consumer advocate syndicated on 3,200 radio stations all
over the world."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She and a Dr. Mary McBean, an MD out of San Diego, both had all
the research on the vaccines and the contamination and that vaccines don’t
create any kind of assurance of not getting a disease – in fact that it causes
the diseases in many other, including yellow fever, from vaccines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Since Ida
Honorof was so well syndicated, and most of your news media then were owned by
wealthy families, rather than corporations, there was much more truth in the
media."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So the media watched the polling places where they were giving people
these so-called free government sponsored swine flu vaccines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In the first 6
weeks, 2,323 people died as a direct response within 3 to 10 days from the
vaccines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Many of them got Guillian-Barre disease, which is complete paralysis."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I had all of these facts when I did that show near the end of February 2000.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
told people what books to get, where to find the facts, because the CDC was
saying that only 46 people died as a direct result of the swine flu vaccine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Plus they stopped the program after that tally was computed by the news
networks, so they completely stopped it [the vaccine serum] and put it in vaults
and [in 2009] they were going to bring it out of the vaults and re-issue it,
even though the pharmaceutical house had already received their 8 million $ for
their about 70 million vaccines that were produced."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Here Bush paid 8 billion
dollars for 124 million doses."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","After my show, from my show, there was a rap
group out of the UK that heard that show. ["
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In 2009] they spent a million dollars
on a music video called “just say NO to vaccine”; for 13 seconds, you hear
my voice from that radio show saying “The only way you can get a swine flu is
to be injected with it; you are not a pig”."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I get to talking several times
through the song when my voice comes in on it. ["
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","On the video] they show children
getting stabbed, children getting their arm cut off, and all kinds of things
dealing with vaccines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You can still see it if you go online and put in there
“the vaccine song SAY NO TO THE VACCINE by trillion”."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbSpPs05YAc].
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It is 7 minutes, 32 seconds."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That caused so much ruckus all over the world that 6 countries actually sued
Smith-Kline the company that manufactured them, and spread all over the World
Health Organization that as many as 300 million people on earth were going to
die of the swine flu and that is why they needed to buy the swine flu."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","There
were only 6 million doses administered out of 276 million and a lot of that was
blamed on me because I started the resistance against it from that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I got weeks of death threats and decided I’d better get out of the country so
I got out of the country."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I continued to use my cell phone but infrequently, and
credit cards."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I woke one night April 5th on Ileyte island in the Philippines in the nicest
hotel of this tiny little town."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","For them, that is a big town of about 20,000
people."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And the hospital is about as big as this store; of course I didn’t go
there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I awoke in the middle of the night, half sitting up, and a cloth was
hanging down from my chest onto my stomach and two thugs on either side."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
couldn’t see their faces very well because there was lots of light coming in
from the porch outside the hotel room through all these windows off the porch
out there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They looked like clean-cut CIA types, not in suits but clean-cut,
dressed kind of like I am and one hypodermic hanging from my right arm and two
right beside me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I probably took 5 seconds to register all that and the guy to
my right picked up the cloth that was down in my lap at that point, put it over
my mouth and I was out in a split second."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And that was odorless.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had had ether
probably 6 times in my early life and they took anywhere from 17 to 19 seconds
to put me out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This had me out in a split second so it was like military-grade
anesthetic that nobody has, even hospitals, because they don’t use it anywhere
to have anybody out that quickly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I awoke up in the morning; I just thought it was a bad dream.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","There were no
traces of anybody around but then when I rolled over just a little bit, I
started vomiting, was sick all over, sore all over."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I looked at my arm; I had
three large lumps there with the pinholes, with the needle holes still there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
tried sucking it out but it was already absorbed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I don’t know how many hours
I had been asleep with that in me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But within 24 hours, my skin was exploding."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
had one in my leg that was this big."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I was passing out every 20 minutes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If I
stood up for 5 minutes, I would pass out within 3 minutes; I’d get very
nauseous."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I looked around the room and there was no evidence of anything so
calling the police would have been stupid because they would just say I was
taking drugs or something and would accuse me of taking something."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, I called
the hotel desk and said ‘I need a driver as quickly as possible and I want to
be taken to a wharf – a fishing wharf."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It took about 45 minutes to get the
driver and I had vomited probably about 6 times in that time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Skin started
bubbling up, not exploding yet, in areas on my chest and back and neck and arms
– mainly on the shoulders and back of the shoulder then on the chest in the
next few days."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When he [the driver] got there, I said ‘don’t take me to the hospital."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I am
in critical condition; I’ve been poisoned and the hospital is not going to
help."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I need to find either shark or stingray that is at least two days old,
full of ammonia, to keep t he poisons from killing me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He was very afraid to
take me because he had to practically carry me over his arm to the van."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then we
drove; the first wharf couldn’t find any."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The second wharf found a baby
stingray about two days old, about this big."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They were getting ready to throw
it; thank God they didn’t."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It was reeking of ammonia.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In both stingray and
shark, the ammonia will double almost every hour after they are dead."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Ammonia is
what your kidney uses to keep the red and white blood cells from entering your
kidneys."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Otherwise you’d be pissing blood every time you urinated.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They kidney
makes the ammonia and the ammonia detracts the red and white blood cells from
entering the kidney."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So you are only dumping all of the fluid that feeds the red
and white blood cells, that dumps into the kidney."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Otherwise you would be anemic
and dead."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You just couldn’t create enough red blood cells to keep up with it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Ammonia also binds with heavy metals; it keeps them from being absorbed into
tissues, including red blood cells."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And that is what I needed to do.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I figured
they had injected me with the swine flu vaccine - three doses – to kill me
with it so they could say ‘see, he died of the swine flu."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He has got pig
tissue in him."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He is the one that said you have to get injected with it...”

But thankfully, I awakened when they were doing it to me, to their surprise and
chagrin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I chopped the stingray up a little at a time and had 3-4 ounces at a
time every 4-5 hours; I vomited most of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But enough of the ammonia got into
my blood so I wasn’t passing out every 20 minutes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I’d get very dizzy if I
would sit up for ten minutes and probably pass out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When I felt that way, I’d
go down on my knees or lie on the ground so I wouldn’t fall and hurt myself."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",No matter where I was – even if I were on the street – I would do it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But I
pretty much stayed out of the way and stayed in the hotel room to try to get
through the worst of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It took me 3 days to stop the passing out but I was
still nauseous for months."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I had lots of things discharge.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","[Aajonus gives a presentation of slides, showing detox, as described below]."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This [photo] was two years after I was injected.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Every April 5th, I had a
resurgence of the detoxification."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But the one… I guess I didn’t take
pictures of that one; I was too sick and didn’t have my camera with me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You
can just see [in photo] how it started off; in just a matter of 10 minutes it
would be open sores, just exploding – open."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That [next photo] was a big one that came out when I was injected, the whole
thing exploded here and here so you can see can see how badly scarred it is."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
had some scrapings done in all those places."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","There is mercury – more aluminum
than mercury – in this area right here from the skin scraping."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It was obvious
that I had gotten vaccines injected."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Here [photo] is a whole gray area right
here which is both mercury and aluminum."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This year it came out on the left leg
for the first time - usually it came out on the right leg - and you can see
these little bubbles that would just explode and then seep and seep and seep."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
used to have smooth young skin; not after that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You are watching a progression.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","All those [photos] were the same day and those
were just within a 3 hour period."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This [photo] was the next day, so you can see
the progression."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Question: What is that, mercury… ?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Aajonus: Yes… all that… mostly formaldehyde and ether.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This [photo] is two
days after."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",See what it did to my nails.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","People used to tell me I had the nicest
looking feet in the world; they looked like Michelangelo's David statue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Look at
that foot now."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","All these nails turned brown from that – full of mercury and
other metals… took the nail right off. ["
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Photo] this is two days after it
started."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This is the third day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",See how it is swelling everywhere.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Inaudible question about something green

That was metal; metal mixed with dead dissolving cells."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Inaudible question

Aajonus: It was liquid then turned dry."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It almost looks like impetigo.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You can
see the metal in some of these."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But that is all aluminum – all that silvery
lavender caste – that is all aluminum in there, mercury in this area… This
was after I soaked it hot water for about a half hour."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","See how the skin calmed
down; it is not as blistered and bubbled and rashed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That was after soaking it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This [photo] is a few minutes later so it is starting to pop out immediately
again and blister."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And then it started creating basal cell cancer.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This thing
turned into a huge tumor right here."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",See how large it is getting?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And then it
was gone in about 4 months."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It took 4 months to get back to the beginning.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So,
after it first happened, most of the big scars were up here; it looks like I got
shot into the chest and it came out my shoulders."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It looks like I was hit be
shrapnel it was so bad."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And this last year – not this April but the previous
April it was pretty mild; it wasn’t a big deal."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This [photo] was January 2013… it wasn’t so bad in various parts of my body
– some skin rashing – but then in September, it hit me in the arm, and in
October it got extreme."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Still right now when I lift the arm this high, I get
pain pretty badly right here."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Some days I can’t even lift it at all, so I am
still suffering from that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This arm has lost… it is 2 inches smaller than this
one, from those injections in there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This is one of the detoxifications that
turned into melanoma from that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I put vinegar on it and pineapple juice and got
rid of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I don’t show it cleaned; it still flakes off a little bit - gets a
little bit of a scab but it’s more like just a peeling wart now when It
appears."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This was in July and September; this was when I started to detox
usually in April it came."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In 2012 it came quite a bit and stayed all the way
through September – April through September."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Almost all that skin does not sag
any more – all those rashes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But you can just see how things come through the
skin – so know that it’s industrial toxins that are coming through the skin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Now I didn’t even scratch this but it came out this way.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had one in my
earlobe that came out that way – just like that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It looks like two scratches;
I didn’t scratch it at all."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And they keep popping up about every 3 days and
then going away."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This happened in April of 2002.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I had 16 mercury fillings in my mouth that I had removed in 1978.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In 2002, you
see the mercury coming out of this part of my face and my jowl that it stored in
my face for that long."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","No, this isn’t white blood cells here, this isn’t
puss."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This is actually burned cells from the mercury; it burned them.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It looks like puss, doesn’t it – burned dead cells from the mercury."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Question: How did you treat that?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Aajonus: I put lime juice on it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Lime juice is an antimicrobial.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It will also
surround any foreign particles that enter the body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","For instance, when I had the
motorcycle accident and all the skin was gone - and even when my skin was
exploding – I put the lime juice on the wounds to surround any of the mercury
– the particles – to help neutralize them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I found that when I did that in
the motorcycle accident, all that asphalt that I couldn’t get out of the
muscle tissue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",because I had shaved off the skin.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had these asphalt particles
in the muscle and it was too painful to remove each one."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had probably
thousands of particles in all of my muscles and skin from all of those wounds
and putting the lime juice on there stopped my body from using the white blood
cells to go there and make infection to eat up the damaged cells."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It completely
surrounded those particles and made them invulnerable to bodily fluids so they
were unable to harm me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then for the next year, they [the particles] would come
out to the surface like little bitty warts and I would peel them away, open them
up and there was the asphalt and a little sand."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It was still coated with that
lime juice!"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, lime juice is the perfect thing to prevent severe deterioration
of tissue from foreign particles."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So that is what I used on that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then I put coconut cream all the way around to help pull out any kind of
toxicity that may be coming out in the tissue locally or absorbing into the skin
and the coconut cream going in and helping to break this down so it wouldn’t
do so much damage."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Now you never want to stop an area that is discharging.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Your
body always picks a safe area to discharge."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So it is not a good idea to stop it
from detoxing from one area and force it into another, like with cancer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Like
with Angelina Jolie, she lopped off both of her breasts but what did she remove
at the same time?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",She removed 22 lymph glands.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now lymph glands are to clean the
body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Lymph glands prevent cancer because they dissolve cells.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Cancer is nothing
other than the body’s inability to dissolve dead cells."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So the body collects
them if the lymphatic system can’t break them down and dissolve them and get
them out of the body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So now she has 22 lymphatic glands gone and the breasts
were protecting everything out of the lungs, so where is that cancer going to go
now?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Into the lungs.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Where will dead cells collect?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",In her lungs and under the armpits.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She traded
one for one."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It would be better to have cancer than to lump your breasts off.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If
you are going to do it that way, then lump them off before."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Because now there
are only two places it can go: lungs and the armpits and destroy the arms."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
have seen it multiple times."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",[photo] This was a finger detox 2008.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now this finger had been cut off in a
lawn mower when I was 3 years old and the doctor at the hospital – this young
intern - thought he had all kinds of great ideas so he took a tetanus shot; he
not only injected my butt with it but he injected the finger all around this
finger."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So here I am at almost 60 years old detoxing all of that out of this
finger."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now my body lost very few white blood cells in it; you can see it is
mounting up here and it leaks out this area right here."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That is where I lost
some white blood cells."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You can see it has already leaked once already.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You can
see what it did to the nail; this is a while later; see how it deformed the
nail."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This nail used to go straight back.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It pitted the whole thing; it took all
of the minerals out; minerals were used to bind with heavy metals coming out
here."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Tetanus shots have more mercury and aluminum than any other vaccines.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This is a woman who came to me with nose cancer.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This is when she came to me.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They wanted to… the reason she came to me was because they gave her a ‘fait
accompli’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They told her they were going to take all of the skull facebone –
jaw and everything – open the skin from the center, peel it back, replace it
with a plastic prosthesis - all of her bone, everywhere."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They were going to
duplicate her bone frame by taking a mold of her face."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If she survived it, she
wouldn’t have cancer; that is what they told her."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And the odds of that were
about 25% success/ 75% failure."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So she said “No Way!”.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So she came to me.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This [photo] was the condition of her nose when she came to
me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I said “Barbara, you are only going to lose your nose; I can’t prevent
you from losing your nose but you probably are going to lose your entire nose."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
had her putting vinegar on it and pineapple, just a little bit of juice on it,
and lime juice periodically."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You can see it is not as inflamed.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It is calming
down even though it has all these scabs on it – like impetigo scabs on it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That is fluid.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You can see how deep it went.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In the last one, see how it is
starting to heal over here."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The skin was way back over here; now it Is starting
to heal."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I thought she would lose her nose; I didn’t know she would start
healing again but she did."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","How she got it was… she was a night club singer and
smoke of course could have had some responsibility in it but now they don’t
use dry ice any more to make smoke for entertainment."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They use hydrogenated oils
– vaporized hydrogenated oils so that is liquid plastic they are putting in
the air."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So any time you are at a show, I don’t care if it is the Comedy
Store, a night club, whatever it is, when you see that stage smoke, that is
vaporized liquid plastic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That’s worse than having smoke.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, she was a night club singer and they used a lot of smoke at the club where
she was at; the new kind of smoke and that caused it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","There were those kinds of
particles."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She had had all sorts of plastic discharging all throughout this; it
got into her sinus and up into her brain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She told me she was going to get brain
cancer but it never happened."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She lived 7 years more and had her children at her
funeral."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",She didn’t die of cancer.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She was eighty-some years old when she
died."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Her daughters came up to me at her funeral and said ‘thank you so much;
she was supposed to die 7 years ago and we got to spend these last years closer
than ever."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Even though some people can’t recover from this much damage… the
cancer didn’t kill her."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She had to wear a bandage over that nose and she was
not hired as a singer any more."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Malcolm Gold [photo].
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He is a bass player and did a lot of gigs with smoke and
he got his cancer in the eye here."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I told him when he came out to Los Angeles
and did a gig in Universal City, the amount of smoke that they had was
incredible."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had to sit way in the back and I wore a mask during the whole
performance."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I said ‘Malcolm, you know it’s going to catch up with you;
you’ve got to stop it’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",He finished the tour for another three months and never did it again.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This
happened about 10 months after he quit the gig; you can see how bad it got."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now
he didn’t go to a doctor at all."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He just trusted me… put lime juice on it,
vinegar which took care of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This [photo] is it shrinking down.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible question

Aajonus: 100%."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When he came to me he was skinny as a rail with chronic fatigue
and fibromyalgia."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He has a video on there which says something about my
experience with the Primal Diet. ["
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",see /videos-testimonials/].
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He’s got several
on there and he talks about his experience on the Primal Diet; you can find
these on you tube."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This [photo] was mine.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Since I was a child, an infant, I can only remember
having a very difficult time urinating."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It would take me 3 minutes just to start
my urination stream, then it was very small all the time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When I stopped wearing
diapers and my mother used to take me into toilets to go to the bathroom, she
would get so frustrated because it was a five minute process, minimum to take me
to urinate."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She used to get so frustrated and so angry; what had happened was,
back then, the mercury from all those vaccines I got, those tetanus shots, had
collected in my bladder and started forming a huge stone."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Well, in 2006, when I
was 61 years old… when I was 59 years old I all of a sudden couldn’t pee at
all unless I lifted my leg like a dog."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I knew there was something blocking in
my urinary tract, in my bladder."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","\So I went to a urologist that did ultrasound and not x-rays just to see what
was there – and this is what we found [photo]."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The largest bladder stone in
history."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","There were 4 urologists at this particular clinic and about 20 nurses
– and all of them said they’d never seen a stone that big."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It had been
growing in me since I was about 3 years old, maybe 2 ½. They said there is no
way that is going to dissolve and come out of the body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So we need to come up
your urethra with a tube about an inch in diameter with 3 prongs in there; one
for a camera, one for a laser and a fluid to wash it out in a vacuum tube to
pull it out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So I had 4 tubes going up the one big tube.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So of course I let them
knock me out; I don’t usually let them knock me out if I ever go to them for
anything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They said it would take about 45 minutes to break that down; they
thought I would be under for 45 minutes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It would probably take 20 – 30
minutes to laser and blast it apart."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It took 2 hours.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When he got into the center of it, it was solid mercury and
metal, like a ball, a marble; it took over an hour and 10 minutes just to break
that part of it down."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The waste a 2 ½ gallon bucket that was completely gray
– dark gray from that metal being blasted."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The nurse said ‘I’ve never seen
him [the doctor] sweat like that’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She was patting his forehead every two
minutes because he was sweating so badly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Because if you miss with a laser
blast, you tear the tissue all the way to 2 inches deep."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So you had to be right
on with the blasting."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But I knew basically what was going to happen so I made
sure I had the second appointment of the day for surgery."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So he wasn’t too
tired and it wasn’t the first after him waking up."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This is what it looks like,
with the camera – with coral here and deep inside it was the… He stopped
taking pictures after the first; he knew it was going to take him too long so he
stopped taking pictures."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",See how big that is!
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And there is a closer picture.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Huge!
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So anyway the urethra goes down that way and was blocking off my passage.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now the reason I had trouble is that I started having immense pain in my penis
– not in my bladder but in my penis – so it didn’t feel like glass, like
stones passing through the urethra."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It was in the head and the shaft of the
penis so I didn’t know what was going on."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then within a day of that, I
couldn’t pee unless I lifted my leg like a dog then I was able to pee."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It has
been slow and a long stream my whole life until after this then I pee’d like a
racehorse."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And I still pee well.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So my whole life I didn’t know what good
pee’ing was like."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Here is a breast cancer.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This was the condition she came to me in.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This was all
completely one tumor."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It hadn’t gotten over to the other one yet.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Her husband
was scared to death of the diet so she didn’t do it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","His intimidation wasn’t
supportive."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She didn’t last long; she went for medical therapy and was pretty
well gone."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",She died probably a year later.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Now this is a burn.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It is a woman from Omaha, Nebraska."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This is a burn – a
spontaneous burn that came on overnight."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She had had back pain back there and a
rash and when she awoke the next morning, this was like an explosion in her
skin, just like I had."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But from the smell of the skin tissue that I got to see,
it was aluminum and sulfer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She had taken a lot of sulfer drugs for a urinary
tract infections as a child – and also sinus stuff."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And they used sulfer based
antibiotics for that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You can see how deep the burn went – 3 layers deep.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That
was all the way through the skin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","After she detoxed enough, I had her put the
meat on."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You don’t want to put the meat on and seal it up before the toxins
are gone."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had her put lime juice on it, coconut cream, honey just while it was
detoxifying then meat once it stopped seeping."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","There [photo] is when it was at
its worst."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",See how it just came through the skin?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It burned a hole right into
the skin, deep, all the way through."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That’s coconut cream on there, melting."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Iaudible question

Aajonus: no, what I usually tell people to do is to put one on top of the
other."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Lime juice first, honey second then coconut cream on top."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible question

Aajonus: no, because that would dry it out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then you’re going to have more
scarring and more damage."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had her put bandages on that had the coconut cream
on it and some honey on it, and kept the bandage damp so this wouldn’t dry
out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I did not want this to dry.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I told her when she had that bandage off, ‘do
not let it dry’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Keep at least coconut cream on it; do not let it dry.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Do you
see how bad this was?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She did use some clay this [photo] day and I said ‘do
you see what happened – do you see how it spread?’"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The body started throwing
it off out here because it can’t throw it off here."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Do you see how the red
started spreading?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I said ‘don’t use clay for that… its not a good
thing’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This [photo] is the clay after she washed most of it off the next day;
some of that clay stayed in the tissue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And this [photo] is as it was healing.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Now this [photo] was an autistic girl brought to me at 9 years old.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She was
this way when I met her."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This was her whole life… mouth open… that was all
she did."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",She didn’t sleep.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Her mother had to sleep sitting up holding her
because she would fall down, she would crack her head open."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She actually had to
be held or strapped in something."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And when you strapped her [Aajonus makes a
loud groaning sound] she’d be making all kinds of noise."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This is just a year
later, on the diet… she is actually holding… she still can’t talk…
because she is only doing the diet about 50%."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She lives in Antigua and to get
food there, she has to ship all the way from Amos Miller in Pennsylvania."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So she
doesn’t get what she needs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But that is improvement within a year on the diet;
… a BIG difference."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That [next photo] was a Christmas present for me.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible question

Aajonus: No, she couldn’t do anything; she couldn’t feed herself or
anything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",They had to almost put a tube down her throat to get food in.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now she
does everything but talks; she still doesn’t talk."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Here [photo] is a nasty rash.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This guy loves salt and chips; he has had a lot
of antibiotics, a lot of penicillin in his lifetime and that is exactly what is
coming out here: penicillin fungus and residue and salt."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","His skin is exploding
because of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible question

Aajonus: Well you can put pineapple, papaya and things like that to break down
the scar tissue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You still might have some scarring but would be mitigated if
you didn’t use the clay."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Now this guy put lime juice on it and coconut cream.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I said ‘don’t let it dry’.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He put bandages on it with the coconut cream in
the bandage so it wouldn’t dry and a damp cloth over that, double layers of
moisture from good water like Gerolsteiner then plastic over that and an ace
bandage over that so that it wouldn’t dry."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You don’t want these things to
dry."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That took about 3 weeks to go through that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now this girl [photo] also had
breast cancer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",She came to me with breast cancer.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That [photo] was about how she
came to me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This was at the worst.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This is when all the cancer stopped.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","All of
this fell off."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I told her she would probably lose her breast but she only lost
half of it, like the woman lost half of her nose, but I always prepare them to
lose the whole thing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible question

Aajonus: Yeah, it just fell off."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","However she went home at this point just like
this and her whole family freaked out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",She was from New Zealand. …
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Freaked
out!"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",They were just on her and on her; she got depressed being there.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This fell
off."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",They thought she was going to die because she was bleeding.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I told her to
drink the greenish-white cabbage juice to stop the bleeding; it stopped the
bleeding, almost all of it, within a few hours."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But they talked her into going
to get chemo and she was dead in two weeks. …"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","All the years that I worked with
her to get her through that and then her family just destroyed her."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She was so
good about it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I am just trying to show you the good and the bad.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Jeff Slay [photo] in St. Louis.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He came to me when he was this thin but he was
even 15 pounds lighter than this."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",He was partially recovering.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He went to Dr.
Mercola."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Dr. Mercola put him on my diet, at least the milk and the raw meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Then he stopped; he wasn’t doing so much better.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This [photo] is 6 months
after I worked with him… no exercise."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible question

Aajonus: Yeah, he’s got a lot of fat; that is where I want it, in the
muscles."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",He’s got some under the skin but there is plenty there.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I don’t
care how you put the body fat on as long as its on – in the muscles or outside
the muscles - I don’t care."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",He is 22% body fat there.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Here [earlier photo] he
was about 2%."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible question

Aajonus: Its all got to go to the stomach first."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Most of is went to the tummy
so he had a much bigger tummy."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Then it started spreading out over the 6 months.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",But you always have to put it on the stomach first – like a baby.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This [photo]
is a fellow who has been off and on the diet since 1978."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",He’s almost 70 now.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",He’s got pretty good skin everywhere.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",He had lots of vaccines.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He had learning
challenges and communication challenges."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And a lot of stuff that was detoxing
from his brain came out his neck."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So you can see it made his neck is like an
elephant: very thick skinned."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I asked him to alternate… to put vinegar on
it… this is already cleaned…

This is a year later."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You can see how much thinner the skin is.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had him rub
pineapple in gently on for 30 seconds one day, raw apple cider vinegar the next
day then coconut cream or bone marrow and butter to heal the skin a little bit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You can see the changes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This [photo] was when he started.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You can see the
changes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This was about 6 months after he started; you can see already
improvement."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I just saw him last week and his skin is even better.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He doesn’t
do it regularly or as often as I would like – every day – but he does it
probably about 3 days a week."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This is a girl who also lived in Antigua.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I have a picture of when I first
started with her."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",She is lying on a bed like this.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",She looks skin and bones now?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She was just skin ON bones then, no muscle at all underneath."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And she was black;
deep black patches all over her skin and she was naked so she asked me not to
show those pictures to anyone."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I said ‘ well black around the eyes…’ She
said ‘I still don’t want some of you to know its me’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Anyway, she was a
sophomore in high school and they lost all of her vaccine records so they told
her she had to go take them all again. ["
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","loud groans and ‘Oh No’ from the
audience]."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Ten days later she was completely a vegetable with Guillain-Barré
disease, which is total paralysis."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She couldn’t eat; they had to feed her
through a tube."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",She was on oxygen.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She came to me three years after the incident
and when she came in a wheelchair."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She had to cross a threshold that was
probably an inch raised."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Her mother took five minutes to get over that threshold
and she still cried and moaned in pain – just to get over a threshold in a
wheelchair."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you touched her… excruciating pain like somebody with MS and
basically she had MS – multiple sclerosis – which is completely drying,
deadening and hardening of the nerves so then there is no connection to the
muscles or anything so they just deteriorate and go away."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Her voice was so soft
that her mother had to put her ear up against her mouth and work hard at
understanding her."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I couldn’t understand a word.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I gave her about half a cup
of my kefir while I was talking to her and examining her."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She couldn’t hold
her head up; her head was down and she had her arms on the wheelchair."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Her only
movement was her lips and crying – her eyes could move."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I fed her through a
straw… I blended up the kefir so it would be thinner, not so thick, and I let
her sip the kefir."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","After half a cup, she smiled for the first time in three
years

[Aajonus voice is expressing grief]."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","[Aajonus is still crying throughout the next few sentences:] She actually felt
a little bit good."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",She had a whole cup and a half before she left.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And she was
actually able to lift her head a little bit – just from a cup and half of
kefir."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It was kefir I made with my spit and not regular kefir from Amos.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
didn’t tell her that I made it with my spit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This [photo] is her a year later,
feeding herself."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She can only do the diet 50% because they live on Antigua
island."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And all of these black people… Antigua island… The child Fran Wilke
– her husband - works for a pharmaceutical company there on Antigua island,
making vaccines, and he is still working for them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I don’t get it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I don’t
get it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",He could find another position somewhere; he is a smart man.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So this [same photo] is a year after being on my diet 50%.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Now this [photo] is an interesting case.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This is a guy who went on my diet with
a tumor in his jaw, on the right side."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible question about a goiter

Aajonus: No, that would be a thyroid swelling; this is a tumor."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This just kept
getting bigger and bigger no matter what he did on the diet."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It just kept
getting bigger and you see… starting to get rosacea there and blood vessels
are breaking and exploding in the skin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It is starting to happen around here
too."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It kept getting bigger.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",He was unable to swallow or talk.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",He’s not young.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",He is probably sixty seven here.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Of course I am 67 now so to me he is young.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When it started cutting off his respiratory tract… he was a member of Kaiser
through the company he worked for… so it took me 3 weeks to talk his surgeon
into cutting out the tumor… without taking out the whole jaw."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He wanted to
take out the whole jaw, put in a plastic prosthesis, take his thyroid out and
remove all the lymph glands and take the tumor and all the skin with it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And
then graft skin from his buttock and thigh - or one or the other - to this area."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I said ‘wait a minute!. ..
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","first of all, the lymph glands take care of
cleaning the body; if you remove them, what is he going to have to clean
with’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","All of this dialogue… can you just cut out the tumor… ‘But if its
in the jaw, I want to cut out the jaw...’ I said ‘it won’t be!"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I have him
on a diet that will keep it from adhering to any tissue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","All you have to do is
scrape it away… remove it… anything that might be attached to it… it will
not be fingerprinted or fingered into the tissue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I know how to do that with
diet."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In any case, I haven’t been able to stop the tumor from growing’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So
it just kept growing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So they cut it from here, you can see, this is the second
growth – that’s how inflamed and red it is."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And you can see where the last
cut, the last removal surgery… this is a cut from here all the way back to
here."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So this is the second one that grew, almost right away."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You can see the
incision here, all the way up and around."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And he did a good job on the first one
but he wouldn’t do it again!"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He said ‘Kaiser won’t let me do it again
unless I take the bone and I do drastic measures’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I said ‘Well, that’s
stupid, isn’t it?’"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Because you’re going to charge him to take all that
extra stuff out and then he is going to be in worse condition and end up with
mouth or throat cancer, or lung caner or breast cancer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So this [photo] was when
it was so big, he decided to go have some minimal alternative chemotherapy from
this guy in Nevada."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",He was dead in two weeks.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I had the surgeon keep the tumor for me.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I said they could take a piece to test
it if they want."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This was the tumor that was cut out the first time.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They did
cut some of the skin with it; he didn’t scrape it all away, which he should
have… probably wouldn’t have that sore if he had not had the skin cut away."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But that’s [photo] the tumor, the other side of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You see it wasn’t
attached anyway; no fingers anywhere – just sitting on top of the bone with
connective tissue so all you had to do was just barely scrape the connective
tissue away."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But when I had it analyzed, it cost almost $9,000 to have it tested
for everything I wanted."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Guess what was in it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible voice

Aajonus: Nope."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Minerals and ether – I mean kerosene.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","99.9% of all vitamin
supplements are made with kerosene."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This guy, and I don’t know why he didn’t
tell me, was taking 120 pills a day… vitamin supplements a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So he caused
his cancer from industrial toxicity and he had the so-called natural best ones;
I will go into that when we finish this."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That [photo] is a good shot of it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",OK.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This [photo] is a sty on this woman’s eye.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Doctors said it would stay
there her life if she didn’t cut it out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I told her to use lime juice and
pineapple on it only, and coconut cream – alternate what she put on it three
times a day – pineapple one time per day in the morning."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Sometimes she put
vinegar on it, sometimes coconut cream on it and lime juice."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible question

Aajonus: Yeah, that’s it!"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And don’t wipe it off.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then she had the coconut
cream on at night to make sure she got enough fats around it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That only lasted 4
weeks."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible question

Aajonus: Yes, not the whole thing; this area didn’t close but this did."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now
here is a woman [photo] who cut off her finger. ["
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","voice in the audience who knows
her] Aajonus: Yeah, Renee."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",There [photo] is when it was first cut off.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You can
see it cut off the bone about 1/8th of an inch – maybe 3/16th of an inch of
bone, pretty close to this joint."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She grounded it off in a coconut grinder, so
there was not ‘putting it back on’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This [photo] is about a year later.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible question

Aajonus: Yeah, see this is where it is growing out… see where it’s growing
out, her new finger?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",See the nail?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","long statement/question

Aajonus: Yeah… finished growing… use the nutrients to regrow the finger…
Here [photos] are different stages of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",There it is again after a year.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And
now – I just saw her three weeks ago in Stockton, Missouri - it even looks
better now. ..."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Very little deformity at all in the nail; just a little bit of
collapse over here you can see, in the finger, but the finger looks great and
functions better; it has more feeling than her other digits."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible question

Aajonus: First I had her do the same thing I did in my motorcycle accident: put
lime juice, honey, coconut cream and then meat on top of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She did that for 9
months – every 3 days."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When it got too stinky, then change it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible question

Aajonus: Absolutely; it will heal faster because the bacteria help things grow
quickly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now, this [photo] is a young girl who got lots of vaccines and had a
terrible allergy to them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",She breaks out from anything.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I mean you can look at
her sideways and it will cause her to break out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",She is only 19 or 20 here.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","What
she did was she fell and then crushed her ankle bone while she was jogging at
college."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You can see the burns here.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","See there: she was running at night,
probably 11:00 at night and they had these big roots coming out of this tree and
she hit it the wrong way and it caved in on her left foot and crushed the whole
area around the ankle; you can see how bruised it is."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And then as she was
getting well – I said to pack meat on it like boxers do – so she did but
then she started breaking out all around because it stopped the detox."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Whenever
you have bruising like this, that discoloration is red blood cells that have
gotten out of the bloodstream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now you’ve got red blood cells in the tissues
where they don’t belong."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Those have to decompose; they have to bacterially
break down."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They turn black in the process; sometimes molds are a part of that
process so you’ve got black and blue then it goes to yellow as it turns into a
serum and then discharges through the skin as a yellow… a yellow tarnish under
the skin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But she developed this rash from putting the meat on but we had to do
that to keep the bone… because she crushed this bone here – so to get the
bone to regrow… had to put the meat on it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",But she had to deal with the rash.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You can see how it is turning yellow, with dried skin; I had her putting butter
on every day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then the butter would cause some more rashes but I said ‘you are
going to have to deal with that; put hot water bottles on it’ - to help her
perspire out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now this is…

long inaudible question

Aajonus: I can tell you my hypothesis for it – that you have all the bacteria
and the fats – everything the same as in your skin; animal flesh."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But you look
at all the boxers after they have been in a fight; you see these cuts and these
bruises… then you see them two weeks later and there is nothing wrong and they
haven’t had any plastic surgery."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They put steaks on their face all day long
every day for two weeks; all of it repairs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Pretty amazing!
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible question

Aajonus: Yeah, your black eye will go away in days instead of weeks."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now this
[photo] is vitamin C here; this is vitamin C as its in food."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And this [photo] is
vitamin C after it has been dissolved and made into a pill."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They are NOTHING
alike! …"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And this is full of kerosene now and all cauterized similar to a
ceramic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And that is what they expect you to get vitamin C from.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The vitamin C
is nothing like vitamin C. It is mainly ascorbic acid with lots of kerosene or
gasoline – hexane in it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And this [photo] is vitamin B1.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Same thing… see how
soft and fluffy all the vitamin B is? …"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And with all of its adjuncts with it
– the complex of vitamin Bs in there…

And this [photo] is what it looks like when made into a supplemental form."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","No
relationship to the ‘same’; it doesn’t break down the same."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It can barely
absorb it and highly toxic with either gasoline or kerosene. ["
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","question: does
that include the injections of B1?]."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Aajonus: Oh, it is even worse."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That is
chemical; it is not even from food; that is entirely chemically fabricated."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And
here [photo] is a Thai woman with impetigo."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They said that if she didn’t take
antibiotics and use cortizone cream, her face would be one mass of scar tissue
and lumps and be forever ugly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That’s what they told her.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I said ‘no, you
just need to put lime juice on it – lime juice and coconut cream, lime juice
and coconut cream and you can’t let it dry."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So that is what she did.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","All of
this is the bandages she puts over… saturated with coconut cream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible
few words Now it’s just as soft as before it started."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She even had some on her
shoulder… that scarred more than her face did."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Of course she didn’t take
care of that like she did her face."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","She went from that to lighter; you can’t
even tell she had impetigo that bad."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Now I’m just going to go over what they say.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",The cells are not round.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Blood
cells are venticularly shaped like a flying saucer, almost rectangular… round
and rectangular if that is possible."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You can imagine it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",We will see some.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They
show the makings of a cell, a basic cell."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That gives you an idea; it is more
like a planet rather than a cell."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But here are your red blood cells and here are
your white blood cells."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","See all these platelets here, all these little balls are
fat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You can see this person is very fat-deficient; they should have a lot more
white blood cells because you can see four and some very tiny ones – these
shouldn’t be even out of the bone marrow at that point because they are not
even mature."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That person is not a well person they took this blood from.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And
this is a vein with the pores in it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This is more like the cell; these are the
intestines of a cell."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And this is the bowel of a cell then you have the organs
here, the pancreas and spleen and other organs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",They call them organelles.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Your
cells are just different shaped of everything but they have the same thing
inside."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And they have a sub-bacterial system just like ours and they thrive.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If
you lower their bacteria level, they don’t work as well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This [photo] is the skin.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",They have 11 layers here.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This is the muscle tissue
here."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This is the lymph area.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","These are your layers of connective tissue to the
skin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You can see all of this; with your pores coming through.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It is quite a lot
to melt through when you take those hot baths, those hot tub baths."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You have to get it all through that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That is why you have to take such long
baths."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This [photo] is the lymphatic system.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It is simplified here.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It is just showing
the main network of lymph glands here in the breast area, on the armpits and
around and in the neck and up the side of the face around the ears – where you
have the most lymph glands."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But it is much more complex than that; magnify this
a thousand times."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It is a web network of both blood and neurological and
lymphatic connections everywhere."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This [photo] shows the 11 that are in the
breast area that you will no longer have to clean the toxicity from your lungs,
so that means that instead of getting breast cancer you are more likely to get
lung cancer and underarm cancer."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you have ever seen anybody with underarm
cancer – it just swells up and hardens; it is like their arm is in a cast."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The
whole thing will turn into a caste: hardened."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",They can’t even move it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",OK!
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Is everybody satisfied with them?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible question

Aajonus: Well, I showed some pretty hard core ones."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Most people don’t have
such hard core ones, but these are hard core ones – just in case you have
them: don’t panic!"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You take care of it!
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you go to a doctor, they are going
to give you antibiotics, cut you to pieces… do all kinds of things."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And then
you won’t be well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible question

Aajonus: Well, I stop them in their tracks now."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They can’t talk with a
patient; the patient says ‘You’ve got to call my doctor’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I tell them I am
not a doctor."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I say ‘Listen, do you think it makes any sense to inject 76
quadrillion to 100 quadrillion molecules of mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde,
ether and detergent… with this tetanus you are talking about?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They never think
about it that way until you throw it at them that way, and then they don’t
fight you on it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They start questioning themselves and even doubting it
themselves if you give them the explanation, well here is what is in a tetanus
shot."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You got more mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde and detergent in ether than
in any other vaccine. …"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","sometimes almost double the quantity of toxins in a
tetanus shot."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Why should I have this? (
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","gasping)

Because the tetanus bacteria cause lockjaw. ‘"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Well, show me this
tetanus’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Nobody has a picture of tetanus because there is not an organism.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It
is just a dissolution."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you have metal rusting in your skin, you are going to
have a breakdown; you’ve got a fungus there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The algae is rust; algae eat
metal."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You get algae eating this metal that is rust.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And that causes a massive
amount of contamination to cause blood contamination, whatever."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But if you know
how to handle it and you are eating properly, that doesn’t happen, especially
if you are using my lime juice formula."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That is what we are going to get into
now."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I am going to give you some formulas.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","long inaudible question

Aajonus: It would have made a huge difference."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","further inaudible question

Aajonus: I would have helped him differently, yes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I would have done different
things for him."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had no idea he was still taking all these vitamins and
supplements."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He had only been to one of my workshops and obviously he didn’t
learn."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That was when I did it in 2007.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But I didn’t find out he was taking
that until I had that analyzed and it came back with all these minerals and
kerosene."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then right away I called him and said ‘Are you taking
supplements?’"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He said, ‘Yeah, I take 105 a day’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I just went nuts.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And
then I didn’t know if I could help him."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",OK.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That takes care of that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Lights, camera, action… Wait until we get settled here; we have to re-plug me
in."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Am I plugged in OK? …
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That needs to cool, doesn’t it… Does everybody
know how to suck an egg?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That way you don’t have to clean a glass every time.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You’ve got a fatter end and a more pointed end.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This is quite pointed; they
usually aren’t this pointed – they are rounder than that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But you always
have a fat end and a slimmer end."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","What I do is, I don’t want to make a hole at
the fat end but I want to break the integrity of the shell because there is a
membrane in there that needs to collapse."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It will not collapse unless the
integrity of its connection to the egg at the bottom is fractured."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I hit it
against an eye tooth, fracture it almost the size of a dime – with no hole."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So
then the other end - the pointed end – I want to make a hole with the eye
tooth."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And now I have a hole; a slight smiley face.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So it’s smiling at me as I
get to eat it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So – what I do is I like to eat the egg white first.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That is
where the protein is."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And that will go to the liver almost instantly, to start
making the bile to digest the egg yolk."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Egg yolk has every B vitamin, every
vitamin, everything in nature."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It is the only food, as I said earlier, that
contains every nutrient in the world … is in an egg."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I suck out the egg
white first."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If I turn it upside down the yolk is heavy and it is going to fall
towards the hole."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I just suck it out when I am holding it down and it tastes
like barely salty water, slime, then after I mix it with the saliva, it turns
into liquid then I swallow it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It tastes like slightly salty water… like if
you’ve been swimming in the ocean, about an hour later, that much salt is what
it tastes like."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It is still lingering in your mouth from getting salt water in
your mouth."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I salivate pretty quickly so I have doubled, before I have
swallowed, I have doubled the amount of fluid so I have that much bacteria and
fluid in that egg white."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I am sucking out about 2 teaspoons at a time.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible voice

Aajonus: You can do that but it works better this way."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Like I say, the egg
white digests in minutes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You will digest it faster.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Sometimes I am doing these
workshops and I don’t eat a lot; I will sip on milk and have an egg once in a
while… all of a sudden I will lose a word and I know I don’t have enough
glycogen to feed the brain – I can suck this and in about one minute – two
minutes maximum – it’s already in my system when I do it this way."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If I just
drink it down… I can’t do that anyway easily because my throat never
developed because of all the vaccines I got so I gag on a whole egg."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I’ve done
it a couple of times but it takes 5 – 10 minutes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This way, ...instantly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So,
by getting the bacteria here [], it doesn’t have to wait to do it here []."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You
can shake it like this if you feel the egg white is stuck to the yolk; you can
just shake it like that and loosen it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then you know it’s just the egg yolk
coming at that point."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible question about the egg shell

Aajonus: Well, it is just undigestible."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If we were a dog or a cat, we could."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","more inaudible discussion

I can show you how it collapsed."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","This is the end I made the hole in, remember?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But when the membrane inside that was holding the egg collapsed, it brought that
shell with it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",See: it’s attached at this end and this end.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Without that
collapsing, I wouldn’t have gotten all of the egg out of it; some of the egg
yolk and white would have stayed inside."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Question: What do you do when you get a rotten one?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Aajonus: I eat it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Yeah, absolutely."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It’s like I say: predigested.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I have 3
dozen eggs rotting in my house."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",One of them for a year.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You can buy century eggs
in China and some other parts of Asia where they will rot them for 25 years and
inside it’s all white powder like funguses – white or black or brown powder,

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",First of all I want to talk about how to clean the poisons out of the body.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It’s a very very slow process.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Remember, I said 50 to 200 molecules of fat to
remove one molecule of mercury, safely."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So it would take several lifetimes to
remove all of that if there weren’t a special way."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Well, in the last 6 years
of my experiments, I found a special way."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now, most of those vaccine toxicities
will store in the stomach lining and be dumped out the stomach into your food
every time you eat, and into your intestinal tract."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The reason the body will
store some of the more egregious poisons in the stomach lining is because the
stomach lining is the most resilient tissue in the body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It actually forms
hydrochloric acid that can dissolve bone, yet it doesn’t dissolve itself."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That
is brilliant, brilliant tissue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",The next is cartilage.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Cartilage is the same
way: it is very difficult to dissolve cartilage."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When you dump the poisons from
the stomach lining into your food, it does mix in with the food so that when you
absorb the nutrients, you absorb the poisons."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So you poison your food every time
you eat – so you just keep recycling poisons."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Some of it will be discarded out
the feces and urine but not that much."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You’ll just keep recycling it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you see the damage that vaccines do – those are the worst – it starts by
going into the stomach lining then going into your food."

are, throughout the body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",The pupil relates to the stomach.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It is supposed to be
a flat black."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If it is not a flat black, you’ve got shiny green behind it, or
silver-lavenderish colors, or usually all three, with mercury, then you have the
soup of vaccines: the formaldehyde, the mercury and the aluminum."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I see that in
99% of all irises."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Those people have all been vaccinated.

told you I did, every one of those stomachs were highly contaminated with all
three of those: mercury, formaldehyde and aluminum."

them, still from the vaccines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That was evidence again of how the body stores it
in the stomach."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","There was no way before that I knew how to bind with that and
prevent it from releasing into the body every time you digest food and recycle
those toxins."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And then I thought ‘Well, in some experiments I had done with
dried foods, I analyzed the fecal matter when people ate them for 10 days or so
– almost exclusively dried foods, nuts, raisins, dried fruits, beef jerky –
stuff like that – even though they were so-called ‘raw’ - digestion was
minimal… minimal."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Why?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Because there are no bacteria in it – no bacteria and
no active enzymes: completely dehydrated."

functional."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you dehydrated and you are dead, nobody could bring you back to

dehydrating is shriveling up and their skin is peeling off because they are
dehydrating."

the reasons for malabsorption of nutrients."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They’ll always call it dehydration

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I’m always asked ‘what is the most important thing that you can tell
people?’."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Because what happens to those people who
ice a wound?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",They stop swelling.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",What is the reason for swelling?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They have
damaged tissue in an area that needs more circulation of blood, of lymph, of
neurological fluids all in that area; to feed that area to break down the
damaged cells and remove them and to heal… to help cells reproduce fast."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If
you don’t have that swelling, there is no proper healing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So what happens when
these athletes ice things?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They are getting surgery after surgery year after
year to scrape the scar tissue out – because they’ve stopped the swelling."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They’ve stopped the normal flow of nutrition into that area so that they can
clean that area and get well."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Just because a coach wants you out there on the
field, that’s not for your well being."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That’s for him to win a game.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And
you’ve just got to say ‘this athlete’s not going to work after 38 – 39
years old’."

going to be all scar tissue, or their elbows or shoulders or necks, whatever is
involved is going to be scar tissue."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So they have a limited life span.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Go to Chile; what do you see down there?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You see 90 year old men doing a

longer, but you have to kick it perfectly straight and that is part of the
achievement."

doing this for 100 miles."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You don’t see anybody
here doing that because they’re full of toxicity, they’re full of
malnutrition; they have all kinds of problems."

it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They are not even in competition, they are just running."

to do anything but run and they’re burned out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Very few make it.

running to be running."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And then they are recuperating for 3 – 4 months after.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It’s not a good sign of health.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","OK – back to this stomach toxicity, this intestinal toxicity."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I started
recommending that because of dehydrated foods, they don’t absorb a lot and you
can’t digest a lot but when I checked the fecal matter, I found a lot of
toxins embedded in this dried matter that was coming out. …"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","a lot of
constipation but high ratios of toxins in that dried food and I said ‘How
about cheese! ..."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","let’s try cheese; high minerals, dehydrated, can’t digest
it unless it’s cooked or with salt, that fractionates it so you can re-digest
the cheese."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So, it has to be no-salt raw cheese so it goes through the system
and collects poisons."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So about three years ago, a little longer than three, I
got a lot of people to do it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Before, I had a few people doing it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But 3 years
ago I started doing it because the success was so great with 50 people, I tried
it with probably 200 people."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I said ‘When you get up in the morning, you eat a
tablespoon or 2 tablespoons."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you are a guy this big, you eat three
tablespoons of cheese."

just pick it up."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And it does!

fuel going."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The body will always make its glycogen the first part of the day –
in the first 6 hours – for the whole day unless you eat a lot of
carbohydrates, a lot of sugars, then the body will continue to make glycogen all
day long."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And what that does is that high-carbohydrate glycogen causes a
stickiness in the neurological system in the blood serum and in the lymphatic
system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The blood is the fastest moving, the neurological is next and if you look at
the impulses in the neurological with the transmission of light and electricity
and of course that is the faster moving."

in blood, second in neurological fluids and third in lymph."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Lymph is very slow.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And all of those get sticky and slow even more and in the neurological system,
the synapse fire and they skid because they keep sticking to the axon or ganglia
walls so the thought process isn’t good."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Suck a few eggs! …
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","My size, I will
have 3 – 4 in the morning."

most concentrated and best nutrients for the whole body are in eggs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So it does
perfectly."

and focused."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That will all take care of your energy level too.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You’ll see that
it goes up."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You don’t need coffee, you don’t need anything like that."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","About 20 minutes after you finish your eggs, have a
little piece of cheese – one or two cubes of cheese."

the size of a sugar cube which is a half a teaspoon."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So two would be a teaspoon
worth of cheese."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So 2 would be a teaspoon worth of cheese.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So you have this going in and again
you can have it with butter, a little bit of butter - half the butter to cheese."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you have tendency to get your fecal matter gets... too hard and it's

best."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",After you have the eggs you wait 20 minutes and then you have the cheese.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Question: You said when you started - I thought you said cheese first

Aajonus: Yeah, you’re doing the cheese, then you have the eggs, cheese again -
okay, and then we go for either vegetable juice or meat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you've been on this
diet a long time and you eat the vegetable juice at that time you're going to
find that the opposite of what it did at first - it’s going to make you sleepy
and tired."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So I always have my vegetable juice now in late morning or afternoon.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Sometimes in the late evening because now when I drink vegetables juice I just
want to take a nap."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I am too evenly balanced so the vegetable
juice causes over alkalinity in my system, causes me to get lackadaisical and
even sleepy - not tired but sleepy."

trial against the government - another one."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So many.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So after you have your
cheese again then after that you have your vegetable juice or your meat meal."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You have your vegetable juice you're going to have to wait for at least 45
minutes to have your meat meal after that from the first time."

minutes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I say after you have your vegetable Juice after you finish it
15 - 20 minutes later you have a cube of cheese."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","10 minutes after that another
cube of cheese - I mean 20 minutes after that another cube of cheese, and then
10 minutes after that your meat meal."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you go right into your
meat meal you can go about 20 to 25 minutes after you finish the meat meal you
have one or two cubes of cheese."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","10 to 15 minutes after that you want to have
cheese and honey together."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Always have at least one and a half tablespoons of butter with your meat meal -
you do not want to turn your meat meal into fuel."

changing the meat into a fuel too."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So when you have butter with your meat meal
it will never turn into a fuel."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You have enough milk throughout the day and
enough milk shakes and you have your fruit meal with the fat in it to take care
of that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You can have butter and honey which will fuel the body.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Don't use your
meat to fuel the body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So after you finish the meat meal - 20 to 25 minutes after that - you have the
cheese, small amount of cheese, 10 to 15 minutes after that you have cheese and
honey together."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So like if you're a tiny person it could be about 1 and 1/2
tablespoons of cheese to 1 teaspoon 1, 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of honey."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So 1/3 or
less honey to the amount of cheese."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Remember there are three teaspoons to a
tablespoon so if you're having one tablespoon of cheese that means 3 teaspoons
of cheese to one teaspoon of honey or less."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then you can have 1/2 teaspoon of
honey with 3 teaspoons of cheese."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Very small amounts.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That's to provide the
enzymes to digest the cheese, all the minerals in the fats and the cheese."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That
is where you get your mineral supplement."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now 2 tablespoons of cheese is worth
how much milk, minerals and milk and fat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Quart and a half.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Pretty good - not
your cottage cheese but your hard cheese - that's pretty good - that's a lot of
minerals, a lot of good fats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So you're going to digest that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you do it after
the meat you're going to remineralize the body, you’re going to strengthen
your bones and muscles."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now I have had a lot of people, a lot women, with osteoporosis - up to 32% when
they came in to me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now with the system that I have that I'm telling you now
reversed that in one year."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It used to take me 6 years to reverse that much bone
loss."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",If the person did it 100%.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",10 to 15 to 20 years if they didn't.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But with
this method one of them did it in a year."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","32% replacement of bone in one year -
that is astounding!"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I have perfected this to the umpteenth degree and proved
it with experiments and cases."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So after you have the honey and cheese and you know you can have 3 tablespoons
of cheese with 2 and 1/2 to 3 teaspoons of honey."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then about every - this
depends upon you and what you're willing to do - cheese going through like a
train picking up the poisons up all day long."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Because when I look into the
irises, that intestinal belt all around the pupil is everyone's darkest area."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That's because of the mercury and all those poisons have tattooed into the
intestinal lining and everybody's throwing off mercury, formaldehyde and
aluminum constantly into their food."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Well if you have cheese going through there
every few minutes, every 15 minutes, every 20 minutes - 15 minutes would be 4
x’s an hour you have a little cube, every 20 minutes would be 3 x’s an hour
a little cube, every 30 minutes would be 2 cubes an hour."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","45 minutes would be
two cubes every 2 hours - so you pick how you want to do it every half hour
would be two cubes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So you pick how you want to do it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I do it - when I'm not lecturing - every 20 minutes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The people who have done
that - I have construction workers who are full of heavy metal poisoning and
radioactive material and all kinds of asbestos and stuff."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They'll have it every
15 minutes and how they make it work - they prepare."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",This is how you make this diet work.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You prepare all the foods for the entire
day in your first hour of the day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you make your juices like I suggest and I
show you on the DVD the recipe DVD
[/shop/how-aajonus-prepares-food-the-raw-food-recipes-videos/] and tell you in
the recipe book [/shop/the-recipe-for-living-without-disease-hard-copy/] you
only have to make your juice every 3 to 4 days."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So that's an hour and 15 minutes
for that day to make it for 3 days."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So that's a day when you're going to have to
make more juice."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I mean make more food, otherwise it takes me 35 minutes to
prepare all my food for the entire day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Why only 35 minutes because I prepare my
meat every Sunday."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I take about an hour and a half and I take a 7 to 8 lb.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","chunk
of meat and I slice it into inch cubes that takes about 30 minutes to 35
minutes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then I take as much that will fill a little over my 2-quart food
processor - my Cuisinart just a little over the top blade."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I grind that into
pate and I show you how to do it in the recipe DVD."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I show you how to use the
machines to make everything so much faster, how to handle the machines, how to
work them and which ones to use."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So it cuts your food preparation time into the
minimal."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So I grind that up and it is 2 cups.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I get 2 cups from that each day I eat A 2
two cup jar it’s supposed to be 16 ounces but it’s really 18 ounces because
you have the extra 2oz space in there, almost 2 ounce space."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In an 8 ounce jar,
you'll really have 9 ounces of food if you fill it up to the top."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I fill it
almost up to the top and put those in the refrigerator so I have them for all 7
days."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So that on that one day I prepare all my meat for all the whole week, it
makes it very simple."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So the only thing I have to prepare is my milkshakes if I
have milkshakes, my sport formula, and my fruit meal."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Three things I have to prepare and the sport formula takes about 10 to 12
minutes that takes the most time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Milkshakes can be done in 3 to 4 minutes and
the fruit meal can take a little bit more time if I wash my fruit and I usually
do."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I take whey and good drinking water and I'll sit it in there and shake it while
I'm preparing other things and let it sit in it and then vibrate it, - shaking
it all around - to get any kind of contamination because any time you’re
talking about fruit, your usually talking about farmers who lie."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Because the
birds, the insects, everybody goes after fruit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It's hard to keep them away from
it so they're always spraying."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I don't trust anybody even if they say organic
with fruit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I wash my berries in that whey and water or just straight whey and wash them
and clean them but I will use that water for a whole two weeks."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I won't use it
and I'll put a touch of milk in it too, to arrest those poisons so that it
stays in the liquid and not on my food."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I will use that and clean for a whole
week - 2 weeks depending upon if I can see it getting gray I know there was some
kind of chemical spray on that fruit and then I know to wash it even longer the
next few days if I got the same batch."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So then you know you have the coconut
cream to put with it, you have to squeeze some lime juice with it - and that
fruit meal is coming up next."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Some people can have their meat meal and wait two
and a half hours and eat their cheese and sip sport formula, milk or milkshakes
in between."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Let's say you're doing the cheese every 20 minutes - at the top of
the hour you have the cheese and 10 minutes after that you sip ounce or 2 ounces
of fluid, either the milk, milkshake or sport formula - 10 minutes after that
cheese again - 10 minutes after that sipping again - 10 minutes after that
cheese again - 10 minutes after that sipping again."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So that’s an hour, if
you're doing sipping 3 times an hour and you're having your cheese 3 times an
hour."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If it’s every twice an hour - every 30 minutes - then take the cheese - 10
minutes after sip - it's 20 minutes after cheese - 10 minutes after sip - 20
minutes after cheese again, so that's the way you rotate it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","How much toxicity
in your ring around your pupil - how dark it looks the less time you take
between cheeses."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That's how you determine it - how much poisons are in your
stomach and intestines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So you make the choice.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Some people have it every once
an hour."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That’s up to you.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The people in this last year which I've seen now
more people doing it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had one fellow that he had so much mercury and aluminum and sulfur and from
sulfur-based medications from when he was a child in his intestinal tract almost
black as his pupil."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I thought this guy's never going to have clean intestines -
he’s going to have to eat cheese every day of his life all day long - to keep
from poisoning himself."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He came back the next year we were comparing photos of
last year’s eyes, to this year’s irises and 60 percent of the mercury and
that metal was cleaned out of his intestinal tract - and he was one person who
did it meticulously every 15 minutes every day of that year."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It was a year and
two months since I had seen him the last time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He removed 60 percent of those
toxins in just a year - when it used to take 10-15 years to remove them before I
figured out this method."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So that cheese is so phenomenal everybody has improved 2 to 5 times faster and
there are very few people who are so disciplined as that one person who does the
cheese."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They will spend an hour and have another one and then a ½ an hour have
another one, then an hour and a half have another one."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That’s not a routine
that will work as quickly as you're having it and your timing it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I got one construction guy, on his belt, his tool belt he has one pouch for his
2 cup jar of his sugar cubes sizes of cheeses, cheese bits."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So he’s got his
watch that will go off every 15 minutes that tells him to have a piece of
cheese."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","He'll be drilling away and then pop and then going right back to work
and then you know he's got these water bottles with the straws in them he's got
belts for those down on his hips he'll pull one of those offs and take a sip
take a sip of the other one or just one at a time so he's doing this all along
and he cleaned out 50% of his in one year."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So the people who do it meticulously have the best results.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Everybody who's
doing the cheese frequently throughout the day has good results but those the
more they do it the more results they have and it’s exceptional."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You get your
reward and it's in every iris and everybody who has done it in this last year,
who spent their whole year or more doing that and has come back."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I'm just so
happy because I thought it would take 40 years to get your body back into a
state with the greatest amount of health - minus that you couldn't get rid of
because of vaccines because of too many poisons too much mercury too much fat
needed to remove them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It's not that way with the cheese.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It's spectacular and
of course eating in this pattern helps."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Other people who’ve done the cheese -
and it works very well - but eat their own food pattern and it doesn't work as
well and they don't get as strong so they don't move as quickly in every which
way."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So let's say that after you finish your meat meal and the cheese and the honey
you go 2 hours or two and a half hours eating the cheese however often you
wanted - and then sipping."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then you have your vegetable juice then... if you
haven't had it before your meat meal."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then you wait two hours after that and
then you eat the cheese and sip in between."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you had your vegetable juice
before the meat meal, then you go 3 to 4 hours with just cheese and sipping."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then about noon - depending upon what time you awaken - you have your fruit meal
between noon and 2 o’clock."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You're eating cheese again - every time before
you’re going to eat anything you have cheese."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So you have the cheese and then
10 minutes after that you have your fruit meal. ["
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Your choice of fruit meal]
depends upon what fruit you need: if you have a lot of heavy metals you want to
go for the berries, and if you have a lot of impaction in your colon - if you
have a lot of congestion in the body - you need to move it with pineapple."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So let's say you had a half a cup of pineapple with a half a cup of berries, 2
to 3 tablespoons, or even 4 tablespoons of your bigger guys, 4 tablespoons of
coconut cream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now coconut cream is the best cleansing soap possible, cleansing
fat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Remember 93% of the 80% of fat that makes up a coconut is water soluble.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It
cleans the body very nicely with a little bit of 7% of oils, that it has."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You
can’t use the oils expeditiously and efficiently without those bacteria and
the enzymes in the water soluble fats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So it's the perfect thing to have with
your fruit."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Because fruit does what?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It mainly turns into alcohol in the body because it
has a long way to go."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Birds that eat a lot of fruit - they are pooping in 3 hours.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Monkeys will poop
and pee constantly because they eat fruit and they will be hyperactive."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So in
order for us to eat fruit we need to slow it down because a lot of it is going
to turn into alcohol as it goes through the body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The alcohol is a great
substance to clean the tissues - to help break down solvents in the body to
make viruses where bacteria, fungus and parasites can’t help us to make virus
solvents to dissolve dead cells and other matter."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Coconut cream is perfect for
that but there can be neurological damage because of that cleansing, so always
have some fat with that meal."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Have either 1 to 2 tablespoons of cream or 2
teaspoons of butter with that fruit meal."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now you want to make sure, as it's
pulling those metals out, that they don't do damage anywhere."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Let's say you’ve
got a dry area in your intestines that doesn’t produce mucus - it’s scar
tissue - and the metal hits that; it's going to create some damage."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So to
prevent that, have 2 tablespoons of lime juice with that meal, maybe just one."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The problem with the lime juice is that it is an antiseptic and it is
antibacterial."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So it will lower the bacterial levels and slow digestion, maybe
even impede it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So lemon juice, you add a tiny bit of lemon juice."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You’ve got
two tablespoons of lime juice you have to have at least 2 teaspoons of lemon
juice."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Lemon incites bacteria ;that's why it's a good marinater.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Question: is it a combination of lemon and lime juice together?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Aajonus: Lemon and lime together.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So you know lemon is used to break down fish
and chicken and marinate your food because it incites bacteria, it incites
fermentation."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Lime does the opposite, but it surrounds the poisons so you don't
lose a tremendous amount of nutrients and you don't have damage from it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So that's the process for the fruit meal.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Of course if you have bad digestion
you want a custard, which is butter, eggs, honey and papaya and a little bit of
grated ginger if you like in it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Any place you have a problem that is mentioned
in the remedy section of We Want to Live that’s the fruit you adopt until that
symptom is gone."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That's the fruit that you have at that fruit meal, because
that’s what you need to clean that area of the body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Different foods clean
different areas of the body and different kinds of toxins will be removed with
particular fruits."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So all that’s available in the remedy section of We Want To
Live."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So that's your fruit meal, then some people will not have had a vegetable
juice in the morning at all."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They will want it 2 or 2 ½ half hours after their
fruit meal."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",In the mid-afternoon.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So you have a few hours of eating your cheese, and you're sipping your fluids -
milk, milkshakes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you're skinny, you need milkshakes; if you don't produce
mucus properly, you need milkshakes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you’ve got allergies, you need more
mucus because the body is dumping its poisons out the mucous membranes, not out
the skin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If your skin is jammed, it’s throwing it out your mucous membranes,
so you need more mucus if you have allergies, and that means mucus coming out
the sinuses and throat and lungs and the esophagus."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So have whatever vegetable
juice you like, I have different vegetable recipes in the recipe book under
vegetable juices."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then if you have it earlier then you just go let’s say 4
hours of having the cheese and sipping on fluids all the way up until 5 or 6
o’clock."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then if you haven't been on good diet for long and you haven't been a
vegetarian you might want 2 juices a day and even another one before you go to
sleep you have to decide."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",And if you come to me I will tell you how much.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I will
be able to tell you how much right away and you won't have to use your instincts
or intuition with little knowledge."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You have to decide but you can do it

we've been and what we have in the body."

minimum to have your next meat meal."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So you can have your meat meal as late as
8 and 9 o’clock, and that’s okay."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Remember any raw food does not require much
digestive activity because the bacteria does it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you eat cooked foods the
body has to handle 32 toxins that are formed, 3 of them are called
carcinogenic - the acrylamides, heterocyclic amines and lipid peroxides."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","1 toxin for carbohydrates, 1 for the fats and 1 for the proteins that are
actually carcinogenic as they collect in the body they become carcinogenic but
there are 29 others that cause toxicity too."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So the body is spending it’s
nutrients on dealing with toxins, not only trying to digest your food."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In raw
food you don't have any of that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You can go to sleep with a full tummy, You
might want to sit up a little bit to make sure your food is going to flow down
the right way and not hang up somewhere if you don't have strong intestines
because you're peristalsis maybe slow or dragging."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",But you can always eat raw foods.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Sleep slightly slanted upward, the body and
the head slightly upward from the buttocks and then you'll digest fine."

doesn't matter how late you eat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In fact right before you go to bed, maybe half
a cup of milk, 2 oz."

blood drops to nothing."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It's like chickens; chickens are scavengers, they are meat eaters, they are bug
eaters."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",If you feed them grains and what happens to them?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Once every two weeks
they'll kill another chicken and everybody will eat that chicken."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They've become
cannibalistic because they have to have meat because that's their main diet...
it's supposed to be meat."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","At Amos
Miller’s Farm, I have him take a pallet out there and throw all the guts and
anything he's not going to be able to sell onto the pallet and put it out in the
chicken field with all the grass he has growing."

that grass because they have the meat and they have the maggots that are growing
on the meat that's been sitting there."

are full and they’re beautiful, they’re radiant white and they're full and

feathers, no dry spots, no deterioration, no dry skin, no scabies-like activity

friendly as friendly can be."

that's have been fed in these stalls with all these grains and by-products and
food processing are very terribly nourished chickens."

dry spots, all kinds of problems that's just to make money on the on eggs and on
chickens."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That's not about creating a healthy food because you have to know what
the animal eats naturally and how to feed them that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So in the middle of the night you have to eat or else your red blood cells are
going to become cannibalistic and eat each other."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You’ve seen those people,
you probably even awaken after 8 to 10 hours and you can't move and you feel
like you haven't slept a bit; you’re weak."

symptoms; eating takes care of anemia."

you wake after a few hours’ sleep for a longer period, 3 hours 5 hours sleep
then get up and eat again and that's the process."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Rather than talking about each thing individually, I decided to put it all in
the diet - about the lime juice, the cheese and everything - so you understand
how it works."

astounding, the changes in your health will be astounding."

tremendous, and he was also doing the hot baths don’t forget that."

hot baths 360 days out of 365 days he missed 5 days of the year without a bath."

to have?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","All contamination throughout the body everywhere not just in the
connective tissue and in the lymph glands."

blood, in the neurological fluid, you're going to have it in the bones,
connective tissue from the bones, you’re going to have it in the tendons,
you're going to have it everywhere and some people do."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Because they're just

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When I get on a plane, I try to stay awake to the point where I can take off
the seatbelt because I don't like that pulling that radiation into that belt
buckle but sometimes as we're lifting off and I'm waiting to get to 10,000 feet
I'm gone, and I don't wake up until we're about to land."

because there is benzene."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Do you know the air vent system comes through the
engine to the back of the plane and disperses so all of the air you're getting
is mixed with monoxides and benzene from the engine?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That's why people are having jet lag.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It's not the time or anything.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I never
have jet lag."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I wear a mask and I sleep on the plane.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I wake there and I am more
refreshed because I got all that direct sun radiation which is not damaging; it
is healthy and vitalizing."

publish my books in Finnish there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I go there a couple times a year or once a
year and they're growing season is 4 months and they grow everything fast

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You
may have a couple of hours of so-called semi-darkness but all summer it’s the
light."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It's not as warm there as it is in a southern climate.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It's the amount of
light that the plants get."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",They grow in a short period and grow nicely.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So when
I'm up there in a plane that light radiation from the sun is a good full
spectrum radiation and it charges me."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","As long as I'm wearing my mask and I'm not
getting the benzene in the exhaust from the engines."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You smell it when the plane
backs out you can smell the benzene."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It’s all over in the cabin and it stays
in there the entire flight because it comes through that engine and if there's
oil drippage then you get monoxides heavily, and benzene heavily in the cabin
that’s even caused some flight attendants and some pilots to be grounded
forever."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It has damaged their nervous systems and that happens when probably 20
flights a year of out hundreds of thousands that's not bad but anybody who flies
a lot like I do; you know I'll be on 3, 4 flights a week sometimes and if I'm
going to Australia I may be on 5 flights to get there because I want to get
there fast because usually you have to go to Singapore."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you go thru Singapore
you got an 8 to 12 hour layover there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I have these cities that I can bounce
to but that's like 5 plane trips but I’m there in 20 hours instead of 50 hours
or 48 hours."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So I cut the time down but I wear my mask and I sleep.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I've trained
myself; I wear my mask like this."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I have it, I can show you what I use."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had a
cotton mask made in Vietnam, probably 10 years ago and it's this and they wear
them all over on their motor scooters and motorbikes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Well I fold this up like
this and take an organic cloth, this is a handkerchief made of organic cotton
and I roll it many times, many layers and I put it here and then put it under my
nose, strap this on like this and that makes a tight seal so all the poisons
have to go through all these layers to get there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now I trained myself to
breathe in through here and out my mouth even if I'm sleeping."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Sometimes it
causes me to snore and a wake myself up but I'll go right back to sleep, but you
can train yourself to do it; you just have to focus on training yourself
breathing in your nose and out your mouth, so that's what I use anytime there's
contamination."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",In my car I carry an actual Israeli gas mask.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I got pulled over at the Mexican
border several times because they thought I was a terrorist because I carried a
gas mask in my car."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Audience member - a gas mask on the plane you would look like a terrorist.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Aajonus{ No, that never bothers them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They wonder why and I said it’s not
bacteria, it’s the fumes from your plane."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I'm not afraid of bacteria, I'm
afraid of your poisons

Question: Do you wear a gas mask driving around there?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Aajonus: No no; I carry it in my car in case there is some kind of chemical
spill on the freeway."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then I'll put the gas mask on but you never know what’s
going to be dumped on those freeways in LA."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","There's been some pretty nasty stuff
that's been dumped there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It can happen anywhere on any road.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You know it just
happened to weeks ago in St Louis."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Just south, southwest of St Louis and I was
coming from Stockton and there was a massive oil spill so you had to go around
chemical spill and they were diverting people 5 mile detour, way around the area
it was highly toxic and I had a gas mask."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I'm not going to take a chance.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I've
been there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Like those injections, they’ve screwed me up for years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I could
have been dead and they were intended to kill me and say - ‘see he died of
swine flu and he's not a pig’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Oh, what really quenched my knowing that was
swine flu they shot me with: from the 1st week in January I started smelling and
tasting pork and I hadn’t eaten it in 3 months."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","All the way through April from
January to April all I could smell coming out of my nails, my hands and my
fingers was pork and out my mouth, my breath was that pork - because of the pork
tissue they used to make the swine flu."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","One more thing: I didn't talk about bacteria, parasites and fungus."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I mentioned
that your body has a natural way to recycle cells in the body, the same way it
digests food."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You have bacteria that's in the organism.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now, if you take any
animal flesh and you keep it at body temperature or in a warm space what's going
to happen."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Bacteria and parasites are going to infest it and break it down and
recycle it into the earth."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And the birds get to eat the worms and the parasites
and other insects - ants - eat all that so you’ve recycled everything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The
body does it internally the same way."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Sometimes if the cell is too toxic, the
lymphatic system will absorb it into a gland or node and then the body will use
a solvent to break it down or let the bacterial, parasitical or fungal activity
happen inside a contained environment."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So the toxicity is much.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So now when a
parasite is your janitor, cleaning up dead cells, that's the quickest and the
best."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Parasites can eat 100 times their weight in 24 hours and their excrement
secretions are only 2 to 5% of that waste."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That means that's like taking 100
pounds of waste and reducing it to 2 to 5 lbs.,"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",that’s the janitor I want.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Give me a parasite any day and one thing with parasites you never know you have
symptoms because you’re symptomless."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Parasites work so benignly that you
symptomless."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That's a good thing.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When you have bacteria, yellow mucus coughing
up and when that breaks down and seeping out the eyes; that's bacterial."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you
have fungal - you have a little in the bacteria - eat 50 times their weight in
24 hours, half as much as a parasite but still their waste is only 2 to 5% ."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Excellent janitor; I want that one too.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",When we get to fungus it's different.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Funguses grow differently; they grow on a
mycelium - a milky like serum that goes down into the Earth."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The mycelium goes
into the earth and eats with this - It’s like the blob."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But it's a milky
substance and that goes in and eats the roots of any dead roots, it won't eat
right live roots, only dead roots and then it throws out a mushroom and that's
the spore, that's the sex of the mycelium."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So fungus - that's what it is - it
goes in and dissolves something from a liquid body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It's not a parasite and
it's not a bacteria that has a certain shape like they're trying to claim virus
have - it’s ridiculous you can’t have a living solvent that's like saying ‘Oh! -"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",muriatic acid is alive’.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And what body - we’re going to make up a body, and
where going to will show you pictures of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But actually say show me a
photograph of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Show me a photo, if this is what it is, show me a photograph."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You’ll never get one, because there is no such thing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So in the fungal
detoxifications they can eat about 50 times their weight in 24 hours but their
waste is 15 to 20%."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That's why when you have a yeast infection or crotch rot and
your skin's peeling because you're discarding a lot of waste through the skin, 3
to 4 times more than you do with bacteria or parasites."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That's why you have more
dryness and itching, but it's still working for you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It’s still eating 50% its
weight in 24 hours but just more waste, but still pretty good."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","What happens when
you have virus when the cells are making a fluid to dissolve dead cells and
matter, there is no reduction in waste."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You swell it up like… let's say you're
going take muriatic acid to clean the oil of the car debris off your drive, in
your garage."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So what do you do with the muriatic acid? -
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","you dilute it in water,
then you scrub it, and then you clean it in that bucket, so what do you have?"

you have any reductions in poisons?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",No you have a magnification of poisons.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You
have the solvent that your cells have created which could be like muriatic acid."

this fluid."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Water is your main solvent.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So you've got this fluid in this heavily
solvent body in your system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That's why the difference between spinal or
cerebral meningitis that's bacterial and viral."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you're go in to a hospital
and talk to a doctor about viral meningitis, they freak out because there is so
much swelling."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","There is usually some kind of damage done, paralysis or some kind
of brain damage done when there's a viral detoxification of the spinal cord or
brain."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When it’s bacterial, there's very little swelling and no problem."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So
then they start injecting you with antibiotics for a viral meningitis which is
the dumbest thing in the world; that's going to cause more swelling."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And then
they inject you with all these things that will dehydrate you."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That works but
that's still doesn't correct the problem."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It doesn't help the brain or the
nervous system, the spinal cord."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That's how your body cleans.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","When you have a
detoxification, you want to do the best you can to get through it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And I've
given ways in there to how to get through them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Colds and flu - milkshakes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You
need lots of mucus to help you pull them out."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But with the new bath system
you're detoxing very little out the sinuses any more."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You have very little
symptoms because you're pushing the poisons out though the skin."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And if you’re
not pushing them out through the skin, the cheese is pulling them out through
the intestines and holding on to it so you don't have to have side effects."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You
don't have to have symptoms of that poisonous detoxification."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So the people who
do the cheese and the baths almost have no colds or flu anymore because it's not
necessary."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You're not breaking it down and having to eliminate it all at once
with mucus and sweating with fevers because you're doing it every day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Taking it
out with the cheese instead of the mucus and you’re perspiring it out with hot
baths, simple."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You just have to take the time to do it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But how much time are
you going to lose if you're off work for 2 or 3 weeks?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It's a lot of time off.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you're taking the first 90 minutes of your sleep time in a hot bath and then
go to bed, you're not losing any time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You're gaining time.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",In a hot bath some people... the brain hates to get hot.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I've had children up
to 106.5 degree fevers never have any brain damage on this diet."

tomatoes then the body will be able to detox without so much fever."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Bring it
down to like 106, 105, something like that and then encourage that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Put them in
a hot bath, and let them sweat it out faster so the body doesn’t have to
create fever."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But a lot of people have so much metal in their brain they can't
stay in the hot water."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It's very difficult, like this gentleman here who went
through a whole year and couldn't do it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So what I said was, take a bowl of cold
water with ice cubes floating in it and a wash rag, and don't ring it out and
put it on top of your head when you get frustrated by the heat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Stick your fist
in there, not tight, open fist."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Put them in the water to here, icy water to
here."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Your bones get cold to the bone, ever hear cold to the bone, causes the
brain to cool quickly."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So your hands all the bones are right close to the flesh
they get cold instantly, cools the whole body for people putting ice on their
wrist again that will do the same thing but not as quick, and cool the brain
quickly, just there you put your whole fist in your wrist, the top of your wrist
in that cold water for only 2 minutes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That's all it takes is 2 minutes and your
body will want to stay in that hot water."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The body loves the hot water the brain
hates it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So that's how to handle that.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And when you get to that point, you can get your body adjusted and you can fall
asleep easily."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Just don't do it over a 105 degrees if you're going to sleep in
it; you might dehydrate too much if you do that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So keep it about a 105 and be
sure to sip enough fluids, let's say 2 ounces of sports formula, I mean 2 cups
of sport formula before you go to sleep."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you’re just in the hot tub and
watching a movie or reading a book or something then sip the entire time
you’re in there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",No more than an ounce a minute though.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you gulp you're
going to piss out your fluids."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Most of that water is going to go right to your
kidneys and then the nutrients that usually go along with your food to the
cells, the nutrients with the h2o because of the nutrients to the cells won't be
there so then your cells are going to dehydrate and drinking water does not
help."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Water cannot be absorbed into a cell without nutrients.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It's a farce everybody drinking all that water just dilutes their nutrition, it
thins their mucous on the mucous membranes and flushes out a lot of your
nutrients out of the kidneys."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Water is not a good thing.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You need to eat foods
with nutrients in it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Milk is 86 to 90% water.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",How much water do you need?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
drink 2 to 3 quarts of milk a day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If I'm having a sport formula, I'll have a
quart of that a day and 2 quarts if I'm doing hot baths."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If I don't, I don't
drink as much but when you're in the hot tub or in the bathtub with a lot of
heat you're going to perspire a lot of toxins and you need to replace them but
not with plain water."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That does not help, that damages the body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You need it
with concentrated nutrients."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",The sport formula is 94% water.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now I'm going to give you the sport formula
it's a little complex so you need to write it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The sport formula is a quart of
fluid."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The first three cups of that are from two of at least two of five
ingredients."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You can use all 5 to make up that 3 cups, but you have to use at
least 2, and that's cucumber puree, watermelon puree, whey, milk, tomato puree."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So you got three things: if you use tomato, cucumber and watermelon they have to
be pureed, and if you use watermelon you cannot use the heart; it’s too sweet."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Start from where the seeds end to the rind.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You peel the green rind and you use
the white to the pink where the seeds start."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Low carbs but high in pectin and a
lot of other nutrients to help clean the body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","However if you have 2 cups of
watermelon probably it is not too good because it will make you very horny
because there is citrulline in watermelon, especially in the rind."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The rind will
help cleanse you a lot but it’s also going to stimulate your sexual appetite."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That's the best way if you have trouble in keeping an erection.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Eat watermelon
rind and that will take care of that, and you do it for about 3 or 4 days eating
maybe about 2 cups of it a day, by the 4th day just a little bit works."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So it
works on 90% of my clients that have erectile dysfunction."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The University Texas
A&M is trying to grow watermelons with more citrulline in it so they can make a
natural Viagra."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The problem is that when you do that, you have to use a solvent
like kerosene or hexane to dissolve that matter to extract the citrulline out of
the watermelon cell."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It's still going to have chemicals in it.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Just eat
watermelon rind and that will take care of it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You have got at least 2 of those 5 ingredients to make up the first 3 cups of a
sport formula."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then you have vinegar, now vinegar helps dissolve a lot of
garbage in the body."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",It also takes plaque off of the system.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now when I did my
heart stuff at 15 years old when I started having heart attacks."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","they found in
my right carotid artery, they found about 20% fat congestion in that artery, but
it wasn't enough to affect the heart so they disqualified that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Well about 6
years ago, wasn’t even that, 4 years ago, well every three years I go to life
screening."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Life screening use sonograms, you know ultrasound to test your
carotid arteries to see if it is congested and to what percent."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They also test
Bone density and it's a pretty safe way to do it, it's probably only 1% to 2%
off."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So it's pretty accurate so I went and had it done.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I ignore that carotid
artery that had that plaque on it 20%."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I thought why don't I do something about
taking that off I'm always taking care of other people, why don’t I take care
of myself."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I started taking vinegar and I only took it probably 30 times, maybe 30
tablespoons that year."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I went back the next year and that carotid artery was all
clean."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It had been since I was at least 15 and a half all the way till I was 62
years old."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","In 1 year who knows how long it took I had only 30 tablespoons of
vinegar that year and it dissolved it so I figured the people who have a lot of
plaque in their arteries and in their intestines, that's the way to clean out
some of that plaque no matter how where it is: raw apple cider vinegar."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So if
you are a large person 2 tablespoons of vinegar a day, small 1 tablespoon of
vinegar a day in that sport formula or if you're not drinking the sport formula,
have 1 tbsp in 2 to 3 oz of milk."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Now it will curdled so you can't leave it in
there long when you mix it together and sip it within 10 or 15 minutes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It's
quite easy to take that way and nice in milk and you won't have to worry about
it de-mineralizing the body as vinegar normally does."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I know a lot of people
have done a lot of vinegar and they get bone and they get spinal disintegration."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So it is not a good thing, if you're having a lot of vinegar."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I will have 2
tablespoons of lime juice in it, a 2 teaspoons of lemon juice, 2 to 4
tablespoons of coconut cream, 1 to 2 tablespoons of dairy cream, and three to
four eggs and you blend that all together."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Once you get this procedure down,
takes no more than 12 minutes to put that together."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The time it takes is to peel
the cucumber and you peel the watermelon but you don't have to peel the tomato."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The tomato skins are fine but you have to peel the cucumber and the watermelon
rind because otherwise they will turn your intestinal tract alkaline and you
won't be able to digest your foods that you need to digest which are your dairy,
your eggs and your meats."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Those are the most important.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So sip on that all throughout the day.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you're
taking the hot baths you might make one and a half of them for the day and sip 2
to 3 cups before and during and after that hot bath, 90 minute hot bath."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If
you're doing 40 minute baths just for the lymphatic waste, not the lymphatic
congestion, remember the lymphatic waste is in the connective tissue being

congestion is when your lymphatic system is jammed: the glands and the nodes and
the arteries and the veins - passages going to those lymph glands and nodes."

explosive."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The reason that I say don't add salt to cheeses is
because when it goes into the body, it starts breaking up the cheese and then

that if you have salt in there of course your body will take the sodium

those up and fractionates it."

Paul was the same way."

this antioxidants and I said ‘Paul, you have to ignore antioxidants’; I said
‘it’s going to come to the point where you can’t breathe, you won't have
any energy because you got all this inability to oxidize in your system with all
these antioxidants."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Okay any more questions?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Inaudible question about baths – putting milk in the water vs. putting clay
and vinegar in the water."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Aajonus: Well, it [clay and vinegar] won’t do it as well as having some milk
in there."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Question: Can I still leave the milk in there and let the bath fill up while
I’m still in there?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Aajonus: Yes absolutely.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",When I take one of those hot baths.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I fill it with
scalding hot water and let it sit for 7 to 10 minutes so the whole bathroom
heats up because it will lower the temperature slower."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then I fill it with luke
warm water and then I get in when it gets to about 111 degrees."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","By the time I
get into that water, it is down to 110 to 109 degrees."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then it will take maybe
20 minutes 25 minutes depending upon what the bath tub is made of and if it's
plastic it will usually hold heat longer so could take 20 to 25 minutes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then
I'll let out 2 inches of water."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","At the second inch, I will turn on only the hot
water, cup my hands slightly above the water level and route the cold water
straight down into the drain so it doesn’t get out around in the water which
would make the bath harder to heat up."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then, once that water comes out scalding
hot, I close the drain and then I'll let the water flow in to the 2 inches and
will stir it around so it gets evenly hot during that whole time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Once the 2
inches is finished, I know that water's about a 110, 111 degrees and then I got
20 to 25 minutes again before it's going to drop down to 102."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So you won't get
as clean in your lymphatic glands and nodes as quickly as if you were to have
105 degrees straight because you're dropping down to below 105 in the bathtub
but you will definitely work in cleaning out the lymphatic waste that is in the
connective tissues whether it's in the muscles or just under the skin and you
will keep the cycle of poisons going out daily."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The baths, even if they’re in
the bathtub, they are important and in the hot tub they will be so much more
effective and efficient."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Question : inaudible question about if this data is in
the We Want To Live book."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Aajonus: Yes, under health modalities, under baths."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Question: partially inaudible question, ending in ‘ground meat, butter,
ground meat, butter’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Aajonus: That's okay; you can do it that way.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Question: [someone] eating a tremendous about of butter and I saw Sherri the
same way and I thought they had information I did not have."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Aajonus: When I do I, I have the butter and the meat going in together."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I like
it that way."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I love the taste of butter with my meat.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","See when I was a kid, I
used to love sirloin with all the fat on it and my other brothers didn't like so
much fat."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","My father like his fat but my other brothers would give me the fat, so
I’d eat just as much fat as I would steak and I loved it and I loved them
together."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Question: … 20 teaspoons of meat 20 teaspoons of butter - that's a lot of
butter

Aajonus: Well I would have a half of teaspoon."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","What I would do is take about a
whole tablespoon of meat at a time with about a half a teaspoon of butter so I'm
eating two tablespoons of butter minimum about 3 tablespoons per meat meal."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Question: So bone marrow is a moisturizer, right?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Aajonus: Well just remember: it will bring your skin back to life because the
cells can reproduce faster and you sluff off dead cells at the same time."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Question: So it’s an exfoliator.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Aajonus: Exfoliator and rejuvenator.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Question: So do you have some recommendations for soap, shampoo, shaving cream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Aajonus: Yes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I will either shave with fermented milk… ...and another way to
get rid of wrinkles like that fellow I told you that I showed you with the neck."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I have been experimenting with fermented milks like kefir made naturally, not
kefir made with grains, just milk that is left out at warm temperatures and it
turns into kefir within a few days if your house is cool; if it's warm like in
the summertime it can turn overnight."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So if you take that kefir and rub it on your neck and other areas, the wrinkles
go away in minutes and they'll stay away until your skin needs to be fed again."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So kefir and even yogurt helps revitalize the skin even faster because it's all
fermented and predigested so the skin cells are able to absorb it even better
than the bone marrow."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I just discovered this in the last 4 months.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I was at a
point where I only had kefir and I had to shave and I wasn't going to put in my
hair but I needed to shave and it was the only thing that I had that would give
me a smooth shave and 20 minutes after shaving I realized my God, my wrinkles
have decreased over 50% just from that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I started to experiment with myself
more and other people and my God the kefir works even faster than the bone
marrow."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Bacteria predigest everything.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible question

idea."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",People have been in damaging.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Somebody got into my house or thru the house

when I woke up that morning and I had been gone the day before."

use them, neither of them will work."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I went through everything like
electronically and through the programs, nothing will make them work yet they
are on and I can't get them to function."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Somebody got into my hotel room and
where was that, in New Jersey and destroyed two of my backup drives."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And just
when I was at that court, that hearing in Wisconsin for the farmer , Vernon
Heisenberg, I had to go back and get three documents and those were the three
documents that the jury wanted to see."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","My hard drives and my backup drives were
damaged; I couldn't even get into them."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I spent all night and I bought this
$800 program to work slowly and to recover a backup drive and by morning I had
had them so I had the documents."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So somebody's effing with me on the phone
everywhere I go, trying to sabotage stuff."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I have to deal with that on top of
everything else; it's ridiculous, it's insane."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Question: Is there any particular reason why bone marrow itself isn’t good to
put on injured sites?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Aajonus: It doesn’t work - It just doesn’t work.

Aajonus: That’s why you put the milk and the apple cider vinegar and the sea
salt or Epsom salts in it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That binds with the poisons that's the whole point.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","That's why - when I make my bath - I put that stuff in the water and then leave
it in the water before 7 to 10 minutes before I get in it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Question: So Epsom salt is OK.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Aajonus: Yes, it’s just high in magnesium."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Your other salts are high in
sodium, sea salt is high in sodium, the Epsom salt is higher in magnesium."

both pull poisons."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","in fact Epsom salt might be a little bit better; it might be
a little more absorbent, but you have the milk in there for that."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Aajonus: Yeah, it’s better."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Aajonus: You’re never going to filter out the garbage from the shower.

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I always put the
paper... they always say put the paper last."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I say put the paper first and then
go thru a carbon filter made from charcoal from coconut charcoal, the hard part
of the coconut - they burn that and that creates a charcoal to filter it - and
the last is sand."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Now they say just do it the opposite.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Sand, charcoal and then
paper."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I say not if you want spring type water.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","At least in the sand it's all
natural."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",You'll get some minerals out of it and you'll get some bacteria.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So you
get the water back to the way it is in the rain stream."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So we did it with the
water at my publishers and I just got an email when I got off the plane saying
that the water feels so good, they don’t have to put milk in the water and
vinegar in the water anymore for them and their baby."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Question: Where did they put the filter?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Aajonus: They put it in their basement.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Question: … the water goes thru the filter?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Aajonus Water goes through the paper one first, then the charcoal, then the
sand."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Question: shower ?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Aajonus: It goes everywhere in the house.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Question: How much did that cost?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Aajonus: Well, I didn’t charge them anything because he published my books
when nobody else would so I did it for nothing."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","But it would probably cost him
about... his plumber to put it in… I just built the sand filter because you
can't get a sand filter that will withstand in a house... the only sand filters
that are available are for swimming pools but they only handle water pressure of
50 lbs."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",and in Los Angeles you have 70 to 90 lbs.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",of pressure.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I had to take
an old - that they don't even make any more - an old filter that was made to put
saltpeter in - that means potassium chloride combination, that's saltpeter -
that's what they use in most of your chemical filters."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Inaudible question

Aajonus: Softeners, yeah, saltpeter to break down your sexual ability and all
that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You got this in all your water, you’re bathing and showering in,
drinking, washing your hands and all that chemical in it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","And it gets into the
body and damages your sexual hormones."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I took that filter... I had the
canister with the chemicals that went into the water... and then threw that
away and took the canister that where the chemical had gone up and mixed in the
water in there and there's supposed to be a polyester - I mean a poly carbonate
filter - at the bottom but there wasn't."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","There was old silica sand in there with
guess what – iodine!"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",A whole pool of iodine in the bottom.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They were being
poisoned with iodine every day."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Iodine is an antiseptic… a poison... it destroys
bacteria."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That’s why they use it on cuts and scrapes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The worst supplement
I’ve ever seen is liquid iodine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It contaminates the intestinal tract and the
nervous system."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So liquid iodine is the worst supplement you can take.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Just
remember we are not plants."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Plants eat rock, we don't."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","What happens if you go
put a concentrated iodine water on your plants or even salt?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","What happens it
burns the roots it destroys them, and you think we can handle rock salt?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","No we
can't."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I don't care if it's Celtic, I don't care what it is."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","You put that
mixture that you’re eating out on a plant and you'll kill it, even a tree, you
will kill it slowly, but you will kill it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","We do not eat rock, plants eat rock,
but plants don't eat salt rock and plants don't eat heavy iodine concentrated
salt I mean minerals because it will destroy/ burn the roots so they had all
this iodine in there and there was probably 20 oz."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",of it in that bottom layer.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Little by little it was getting into their water every day and poisoning them
along with the saltpeter."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I just did that on Tuesday morning with the plumber and I took all the guts
out of that thing, dumped that stuff on the street and that's when I saw all the
iodine."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I couldn't believe how much was in there, how much they've been
poisoning themselves for 10 years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",So I dumped that out.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I put rocks in the
bottom, 2 different sizes of rocks, and then regular sand and then silica sand
on top of that because each one is a finer grade and then of course the water
comes in and it comes in here and then goes through that sand and then out to
the house."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I had to wash all of the sand and rocks outside in big pails 12 times
each to get out all of the regular dirt off of it so the water in the house
wouldn't be all murky for a year."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So it only will have slight very fine sand in
it for 2 weeks and that's it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",inaudible question.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Aajonus: Well, the paper and the coconut were 20 inch canisters, well 22 inch
canisters, with a 20 inch filter inside so those two were strapped and bolted
together and then the salt the sand filter that I built was the old hard
canister that was about this high and about that wide."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I was able to turn the
whole thing into a sand filter."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Question: So you created a great system.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Aajonus: Yup, so he'll never have to change that sand for 20 years, 25 years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The paper one he's going to have to change probably every 3 months ,the coconut
one probably once every 2 to 4 years."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It's the paper one he's going to have to
change frequently."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible question

Aajonus: It's just high micron paper .5

inaudible question

Aajonus: Oh no, it's like an air filter in the car."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It's made with accordioned
paper around."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","The coconut carbon filter is solid, it's a solid mass."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Question: … shaving with fermented milk?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Aajonus: I shave with mostly with milk or coconut cream.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Question: But with fermented milk?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Aajonus: You don’t have to but it’s better for your skin, the fermented
milk, but you can use any milk."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Question: But in order to get some kind of consistency?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Aajonus: No you don’t have to have that, there is enough cream in the milk

Question: What about soap and shampoo?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Aajonus: … very bad for the skin, you have all kinds of chemicals in soaps."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","What I use in soap, I take coconut cream and I let it sit out in the bathroom,
non-refrigerated, until it turns pink, then it has fermented."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Then per 8 oz of
water I put 1 oz."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","of coconut cream, shake that, dissolves in warm water and I
wet my hair first and then my whole body and then I put that on and that's my
soap."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Question: Can you say that again?
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Aajonus: Coconut cream and water.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",1 oz.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",of coconut cream to 8 oz.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",of water.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",That's my shampoo and that's my soap and that's everything.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Deodorant - it’s
either lemon or lime juice."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Lemon works a little better.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Aajonus: It's true, but unnatural fibers usually have aluminum in them, because
the aluminum holds things in place, so they put aluminum in deodorant to hold it
onto the skin so it just doesn’t perspire away into your clothes."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Of course it
contaminates your skin at the same time

inaudible question

Aajonus: It’s all chemical."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible question

Aajonus: You know it's funny a lot of people don't even know how those
substances are made."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","See it's like what is that famous company that advertises
they grow their own food and makes their own supplement?"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Yes.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Standard Process
grows their organic food that they make into supplements, but in Chicago I gave
hear a lecture and I said this and there were two top sales people in that
company they went back and reported what I said."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They’re attorneys called me
on Monday, I wasn't there I hadn’t returned from Chicago yet, and they said
give us a call we understand what you said at the at the workshop on Saturday
about our Standard Process brand being chemically treated."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Not true.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","We want you
to retract it, you are going to have to put a half a page ad into the New York
Times and Houston, Chicago Tribune whatever it is, in the San Francisco
Chronicle."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So that would have been about $500,000 for me to do that."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I would
have to spread about a week on each paper."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I got back and I called them and I
said ‘I'm sorry, what is going on?’"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","and they said “you said something
about chemically treated... our vitamin supplements are chemically treated’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I
said ‘okay, have you been to the lab?’"
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",and they said ‘no’.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","They said
what they told us on paper and everything."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I said ‘no, they told you the
laboratory you use can make a natural supplement; defined by the FDA that's a
solution called kerosene."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So your lab is using kerosene to dissolve your food
into a soup to be able to extract the nutrients out of it’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So I said ‘if
that isn’t the process you use then you have created something very special
and I want it in writing and on paper."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","If you provide me with that I will borrow
the money and put it in the papers’."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","I never got a call back because I have it
from a head chemist with a major pharmaceutical company and vitamin supplement
company that there are only two things: hexane which is from gasoline and
kerosene which is so-called natural."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","So all your supplements that are made are
either made with gasoline or kerosene."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","All the natural ones use kerosene and all
those that aren’t natural that still use food are gasoline."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","All the others
beyond that are synthetic fabrications, chemical fabrications, they're not even
true, but those that are made with kerosene and gasoline are no longer true
either, okay."

"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",Aajonus: You don’t want to take it straight.
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","Not a good idea you need to
dilute it unless you want to rot your teeth and your bones and your esophagus
and throat; not a good idea, always dilute it."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","inaudible question

Aajonus: It's highly acidic."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt","It will rot your dentyne, just like lemon juice
will."
"Primal_Diet_Workshop_+_Q&A_Of_June_22,_2013.txt",I've seen it happen and it deteriorates bone.

in the 60s?"

heavy heavy men who look like Arnold Schwarzenegger carried him up on to the
stage

A: Okay, to make an egg high fast, because you can have an egg a long time."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I've

"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If it's in a cool house, so the
way to get some oxygen gets into it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But you don't wanna break a big crack in it
because it makes it very stinky and hard to get and when you go to break it open
its all over the place."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So what you want to do is get hairline cracks in it that
you almost can't see unless you've got a magnifying glass."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And the way to do
that is put it up here and then tap it with the back rounded end of the spoon."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Now you hear that crack?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",You cant see any crack on there but its cracked.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Okay?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Another area, cracked."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Okay?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: How many times do you have to do it?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Well it depends how quick you want it to....

Q: Ok

A: That one is already cracked."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It cracked it to much, there."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It's now its
coming out, which means it's going to get really black."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And that's okay, that's
the way the Asians eat it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And anyway, you just put it back in your carton and
just let it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I do it at least three places on an egg.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: How long does it take?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: It can take about three to four weeks, if it's in a warm place."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: How?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: It predigests.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Just like yogurt and kefir predigest.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: And you're using it specifically at what time?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",For what purpose?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: To feed the brain and nervous system.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Isn't it already so easily digested that you don't need to?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yes, but it won't get to the bowel."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","See, so the bowel, the bacteria that are
in the bowel feed the brain and the nervous system."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So it gets the remains of
whatever's left."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So your brain and nervous system always depend upon the food
that goes through the very last of the system."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So almost all the best fats are
already gone, everything is already digested and gone."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So the way you get the
bacteria - that predigest your protein and your fats into your brain and
nervous system as soon as you eat, so it doesn't have to wait till it gets to
the bowel - is you make it decay on its own."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Its own bacteria will break it
down, the way that your intestinal, colon bacteria would, so you feed your brain
and your nervous system."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","That's why eating high meat turns chronic depressed
people into laughing giggling people in ten to twenty minutes after they eat
high meat."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Well, the high egg is the same way."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: What's it going to look like?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: It depends.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: It smells in the cupboard?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: It's usually very very runny.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Usually the yoke is mixed to some extend with
the egg white."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",If you let it go a very long time it could turn black.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: You still eat it?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Oh yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","That's even the best, because then it means its all completely
digested."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: I always throw those out.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: You leave those eggs for really long time?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: That's the Chinese, the century egg."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But for like 25 years and that's all
black or white inside."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Like powder or.....

A: Yeah almost."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Yeah, sometimes it can be hard."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Depending upon the egg and the
soil they put it in to help it - because when they bury in in soil like that,
and the bacteria starts to predigest and then your fungus will finish it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","That's
why when you open it you got powder."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Its a fungal powder.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Whether black or
white."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But its an aphrodisiac, they cost about a thousand dollars a piece."

"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",The black egg and....?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: The 25 year old eggs, thousand dollars a piece."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But you know its like Viagra
for thirty days."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","There's a lot of elderly people in Japan, China, Taiwan, and
Asia where they eat those eggs."

"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Wow.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But when they make those, their not cracked?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","They just put them in the
ground?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: They bury them in clay or some other type of earth, depending upon what
they're trying to generate."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",But they're up to 25 years old.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: And can we also make them without cracking them?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah but they're take forever.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Unless you've got, unless you're living in a
tropical environment where the temperature never drops below 80 degrees."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: So keep it on the top cupboard and it will hold heat faster?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah...Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Wherever its warm.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: … because I've got some eggs in a cupboard that I haven't touched in a
couple years because when I touched them....ugh.... but I kept them for some
reason."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: ....oh go for it now.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You may have very little of the em- uh moisture...

Q: They're so light."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah see that's because they're probably already evaporated.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","When they bury
them in the ground they don't lose their moisture."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: But are they still good though even though....?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah but you're not going to get a lot out of it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Most of it has already
evaporated."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Do you have to be careful of how many you eat and how....?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: No.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: No detoxing.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: No.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",For example.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And there's a movie called The Last Dance.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And its about
these three African tribe members who are, I forget the name of the tribes."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And
its a documentary on them."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","The country - since the British and American
government... since running that country, have blocked them from hunting on
their own land."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Part of genocide, so, and these were life time hunters."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","They
claim that their land is game reserve."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So there's no more hunting, so now they
have to live on aid food which is powdered milk and grains, you know flour, so
it a really substandard diet."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But it shows the last days of the last five days,
that they're allowed to hunt on this lands."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And they follow three of these
hunters."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And the way they hunt is that they track an antelope or a large deer
animal."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And they'll track them and out run them.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Incredible.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Can you imagine
tracking a deer till he falls and can't move again?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And they go strong and hard,
they're not running, except at the end running to stop him."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","They'll run him till
he can't breath."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",But this film is about that last hunt.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And on the third day of
their hunt, they ran into - I think its a rhinoceros."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I couldn't tell because it
was half rotten and half eaten."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And it was a big animal.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Could have been a water
Buffalo something pretty big."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And they chase the vultures away and they eat this
rotten meat."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Stinky, foul, and they're talking about how good this stuff is."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","They'll catch the deer the next day, they won't have to go five days or four
days because they found this banquet of the greatest food that gives them the
most energy."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And you see them eating that, pounds of this rotten meat."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And the
next day, in the morning they're right on that deer just like that."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: You mean they're running after it?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yeah they ran, they call one guy the runner."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And he just runs down that deer
and that the poor antelope can't move and he keeps circling to show him that
he's trapped and that he can't get out, then the other two catch up and then
they of course kill him and take him back to the tribe."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Was it on the youtube?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: It's called the Last Dance.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",It's a documentary.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Is it on youtube?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: A fellow, a patient from South Africa sent it to me."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",It's a DVD too.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Oh okay.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: So I could maybe order it?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: You could probably order it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",But normally they cook their meat.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And boy when
they found the rotten stuff, no way; you don't cook this.!"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: They know how good the meat is.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: They know how to cook their meat but when they find the rotten meat they
don't cook it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: What if you're used to eating cooked meat and everything and you try to
switch over?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: You might have a little diarrhea for a day or two.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: In the book Aajonus, you have all the symptoms, what causes is it?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Accept
for intestinal cramping, what causes that?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I get that a lot.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: The intestinal cramping.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Yes.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Only symptom I ever get.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yeah, but that's usually mercury or some other toxin leaving through the
intestines."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So you have to eat little pieces of cheese

Q: I do

A: You know, every 30, 45 minutes."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",That should arrest that.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Yeah

A: You still would have a little cramping as it passes out of the intestinal
wall into your stomach."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: No its all in the lower abdomen area.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Lower...so its down here?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And then naval.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",That's small intestines.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Isn't the bowels, they're over here?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: No.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",no.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Small intestines.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So when those poisons are passing through, they may cause
spasms and cramps in the intestines."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Most symptoms I've had, its the worst."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I have it now right now. …
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",".eat some
cheese......yeah I will."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I have a neighbor, he has aspergers."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So I'm asking for
him, what would be the best food."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Well I'd have to find out what causes his Aspergers.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Pardon?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: I would have to see him and see what's causing it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: What did you say?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: … because different things can cause it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: What did.... when I showed him the raw meat, the red meat I had, and I was
eating it, he said “oh I want some”, he said that, his body knew."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","My
neighbor boy."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Yeah he knew so.... and he wants to know when your next visit is.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Visit where?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Here.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Oh probably sometime mid march.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Okay, mid March."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: So a little bit more than a month away.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I'll do it before I go to South
Africa so I'll leave I think it's the 20th of March... South Africa....

Q: Is there a big following there?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: It's growing and then I go from there to Australia.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",That's even bigger.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: And is the, the coconut oil you get from the wilderness family naturals is
that still good?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",No?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I had a feeling.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Why?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: It's a little higher temperature.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: The average.... is below a certain, I think it was below 98 or 98.....it was
a 103

A: 103 yeah."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",It's suppose to be 96.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",So the cold pressed one.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Don't do it?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Well it's just not as good.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Yes......pulling.....I read a book on it.....pulling the recommend oil.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You
recommend coconut cream instead of the oil?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Well, that is an oil."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Oh the coconut cream pull?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You can oil pull with
coconut cream."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: You can what?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Pull, oil pull."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",That means you're mixing oil or coconut cream in your mouth.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And that draw a lot of the poison that dump from the brain out the gums.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","That
collected in the gums and the more during the night can be pulled out with oil,
you just have to keep the oil or coconut cream in your moth and swish it around
for....some people say it doesn't work unless you do a full 30 minutes."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Oh my god.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: But that's people t hat I think are on a bad diet.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And I find when I pool it
takes no more than about 12 minutes."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But most people you know aren't on a good
diet and have to do it a full 30 minutes."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Is there mercury in the gums to....is that the main thing?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","The mercury in
the gums or....?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Mercury not only for the amalgams that you had but for the what the brain
does."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It's dumping every day, every minute, out the gums whatever poisons are in
the brain and because the nerves use a lot of metallic minerals to conduct
electricity and transfer light....

Q: Wow

A: Most of your metal is in the brain."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And when it dumps, it dumps out the
tongue, the salivary glands and the gums."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",That's what creates dental decay.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","The
metal sits on the teeth, people don't brush their teeth, it sits there and works
damage; dentin."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Then the bacteria come to eat the damaged dentin... not the
bacteria's problem."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",It's the plaque that stays on your teeth with metals in it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Especially mercury.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So if you oil pull, that will draw all that's collected in
the gums over night, so its not dripping into your food every time you are
chewing."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: So no need to do it at night, just the morning?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Well morning's the best time.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If you want to do it at night you can, but I'm
not sure how much that is going to do, unless you've gone the whole day without
eating."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Oh

A: Then it maybe has collected some."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Oil pull it in.....

Q: .....in the morning before your juice."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Before everything.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: And what's the minimum.....

A: you could add cheese but then oil pool after you cheese."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: So you're saying we use metals to see light.....transfer light?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: To transfer light, we have light communication in our bodies."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Not just electricity.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Is that like negative heavy metals or positive....is there a difference?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Just remember that when metals are properly absorbed in the other ions all
the other minerals and vitamins, none of them are free radicals."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","They are all
utilizable to benefit."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Even if its mercury or iron or lead no matter what it is.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","In trace amounts, they're beneficial."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","In anything that's industrially
chemicalized and concentrated, they're free radica that does heavy damage."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Free
radical - does every body knows what free radical is?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","When you have atoms or
molecules which have unpaired neutrons."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So you've got a free radical neutron
that's going around damaging everything it passes through."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So to help neutralize
that you need things like - that's all in the new newsletters, that will be
coming out in a few days."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But you use pineapple, vinegar, coconut cream,
berries, any of the chelators with those toxins."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Eggs....anything like that that
has certain amino acids."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So anyway, that's in the newsletter, all of those
ingredients."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Anyway, you mix those like in a sport formula or I do it with
my.....when I'm not having a sport formula; I don't exercise, so sport formula
for me is no big deal."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So what I do is make a quart of a berry mixture instead
of a sport formula, but that will have whey and milk and almost the same
ingredients that's in the sport formula, but I add blue berries - a mixture of
berries in there - to chelate with heavy metals and toxins."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Then I put my
vinegar, my lime juice, everything that's, eggs, everything that's in the sports
formula."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I just make it almost a smoothie.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: You said you put eggs, you said from last week that you had [?]"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","against a
mercury vaccine."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Is this the same formula?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: This is the same formula but with the coconut cream and the dairy cream....

Q: And you also say you put an egg in it too?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yep.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I put, in mine I put four eggs."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",But I'm making a quart there.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","The one I
gave you is not a whole quart."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","The one I gave at the last.....

Q: That was something else with the raspberry."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",That was for.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","you said, iron
and....

A: .... iodine."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Iodine.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: And some other minerals light colored minerals like....

Q: For what?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Other light colored minerals.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Oh

A: Even salt, sodium."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: So we should do both so everyone has something.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: No you do one or the other, you don't do both."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Not in the same day.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yeah, right."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Alternate.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Gotta alternate.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Okay this is concerning weight loss.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","About a year and a half ago, I did
weight loss and went down to about....started off 225 or230; I went down to 195
and just plateaued so I stopped."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","This time I did a weight loss, I was up to
about 250 got to about 196, different scales but got the flu, bad flu ...so I
stopped."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I started eating a lot.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","The question is, one - is that about the right
weight for me to stop and two - should I if I need to go lower should I now that
the flu is almost over should I....

A: How tall are you?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Five ten.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: That's more than I go, I'm 5'8'' and I go up to 190."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: You go down to 190?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: I go up to 190

Q: Oh you go up

A: My, I don't have big shoulders like normal men do."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","My shoulders are short,
so they never developed like a man's, you know, big shoulder man."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","My shoulders
are almost the width of my hips."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",So I'm smaller framed than the normal guy.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So
when I'm at my lowest I'm 175, 170 at my lowest and then I'll go up 190."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: What weight are you at now?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: About 180

Q: You said you gained more and.....you're higher protein and your not eating
cooked fats, so your more dense?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yeah, I'm a lot more dense."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: You don't look fat.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yeah, yeah everyone on this diet, everything is more concentrated and dense."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You don't have all that swelling you know that other people have with their
contaminated food ruined bodies, possibly inundating it with water fluids and
gases."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Gases store through out the body not just in the bowels.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","When you have
chemistry mix not right, you have gas all through out the body and inside cells
so.....

Q: Wow."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Some people can be absolutely huge and be light weight compared to me.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","When
I was this size after I started eating a lot of fat after chemo and radiation, I
was about 147 pounds."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I had about a 31 waist.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Right now I have a 34 waist, but I
was 147 pounds."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Now if I'm down to like a 30 inch waist like when I leave Asia,
because I actually work there, I actually physically get involved in digging and
farming and stuff like that."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Swimming, you know in my lake and riding my horse
and I mean I work."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Physical - because only sex and the farm can get me moving.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","[laughter] So I do lose weight there, I come back anywhere from a 30 to a 31
inch waist."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",But I'm still 170 pounds.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And when I was that size before I was 147.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So you have to look at the difference in that, there's a huge weight difference
on this diet."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","People become denser, heavier. ["
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",laughter].
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",You're the same huh?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Not me

A: oh

Q: I gained 45 pounds and...and I do the [unintelligible] diet."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I can only
stand that for a little bit and then I start cramping."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah well you're not ready; you have too many toxins.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Yeah, just remember
that when you have a lot of toxins like after chemo and radiation, I
was....there's nobody here as big as I was, but I was full, bloated, big for
many years."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","For many, many years I stayed that way."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","When I finally started
eating the meat I could keep on more tissue."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I mean I was bubble faced and
everything, I still have a picture of it somewhere."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: OK

A: Everything."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Well I lost a lot of weight since that.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Those injections, those
horse injections in my arm when I was kidnapped in that hotel room."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","This arm I
felt like it was going to fall off sometimes, aches are bad right where they
shot me here and here."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So in the shoulder sometimes... I've lost some of that
weight from that."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I gained a little when I broke this leg in the motorcycle
accident."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I lost because I had no cast, I broke the tibia's here, the femur sits
on top and I broke all of the top part of the tibia."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So it splintered all over
inside that joint."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Plus, what do you call it, the scapula....

Q: The patella."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: The patella shattered.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And it split the tibia all the way down to the ankle,
in two."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And it had a wedge like this at the back.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It was more open than the
front and they said I would never walk again."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And at six and a half weeks I was
walking, three months later I was on.....what island was that?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Antigua!
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And I
ran a quarter of a mile full blown."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Full blast without even stopping.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Did you adjust the diet, or is that a little extra?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Extra dairy?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Well you know I put, made sure I had some pineapple every day to mend the
bones, but in between I had meat wrapped around, because I took all the skin off
the bone, half the bone here, all of the bone here."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So see, everything grew
back."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",So all the skin was gone all the way from here.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","All the way down, because
I had sandals on and shorts and short sleeved shirt."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So all the skin was gone,
so I wrapped it in meat."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",The skin was healed over in 12 days.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But it took six
and a half weeks for my leg to mend enough to be able to walk on it without
crutches."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Because you came here about two months after and you were walking up the
stairs."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Oh that's two months, that what I was saying, after 6 ½ weeks I was
without crutches."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Are you without pain now totally?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: When I had that accident, this tendon ripped her and this one ripped down to
here, doubled up like that."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But this one has the tendency to move back and
forth, over the patella."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And it causes a snapping sharp pain sometimes.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But it's
momentary; it's gone in a split second."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So that's the only thing that I think:
it's too tight and I didn't take care of it afterward."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I should have continued
to put a hot water bottle on it for probably another three or four weeks later."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",So there's a little scar tissue in there I think.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Once in a while I'll remember
to put some pineapple on the skin and let that break up some of the scar tissue."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I can't feel it, but when I feel that snap on the patella I can tell it's a
little tight."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: What is....to put pineapple in your bath water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: No

Q: No?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: You've got to put it right on cause then it'll just stay in the bath water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Your skin sucks in the Bromelain?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",But it has gotten so much better now.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I mean I wasn't able... Because
of all the particles that were in there, they wanted to open it up and cut me
from here to here."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And they wanted to go in and clean out that joint.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So that
joint was pretty full of stuff,."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",My knee was like this even after it healed.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So
over the years it has gone down."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And now it's almost exactly normal.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","See I can
bend this one down still lower than this one."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But it was up like this for many
years."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And now it's getting close, I cleaned out that joint but it still is not
completely clean."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Four years?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Its been four years I guess.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Four years.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Last thing on that is, next time I do the weight loss can I go below 195?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: If you, let me tell you, when your body stops, it doesn't want to go any
lower than that."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: So that's how you tell yeah, but you can go... Like I told Kathy this last
time to keep going on because it was still summer time."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So I just told her to
continue it, but I told her after fall, then go back to eating."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","She lost more
weight but it took maybe instead of two or three pounds a week it was one pound,
half a pound a week."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Which she lost.... but when it stops it stops.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Since you are not going by normal standards, how do you decide how, where
your weight should be?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: That your body will tell you.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If it won't lose anymore, no matter if you
stay on that weight loss diet, your body is not going to lose it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: So we just stop with that weight loss.....

A: Stop at that....usually within a week and you haven't lost anything, that's
about the time."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Then you put the dairy back in?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",The rotation?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yep

Q: So I've been doing the cheese throughout the day for like three or four
months....

A: How much a day?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Like every hour half hour, sometimes in between meals and just recently I
have had no appetite for anything."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I just feel like full, I almost feel like so
satiated with fat."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Its just because I have butter with that.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Then don't.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Don't eat so much butter with it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: But I don't want to get constipated.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Then you put the suppository in.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Just remember that when you start drying out from the cheese, the body is
saying “oh look at all that available fat in the cheese, it isn't available
because you don't have enzymes.”"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","because the body's going to hold on to it,
try to get it, because that bowel has been starving and the brain and nervous
system has been starving all of your life."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So it wants to hold on to it so that
it is dryer and dryer and dryer, and without the enzymes, its just not going to
do it very well."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: When you implant the fresh butter, coconut cream and dairy cream with just a
tiny bit of honey, and you know, three tablespoons of each of those, and a
quarter teaspoon of honey into a four ounce jelly jar."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Shake that together, put
it in a bowl full of hot water, hot water enough to make your hand feel
uncomfortable after six seconds..... But not burn it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Get that dryness out
[laughter and mumbling]."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So you let it in there for four or five minutes, take
it out and have a bulb syringe, now the bulb syringe is they have the very
little short little....and that's not good enough."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You need one like a, you get
a douche bag with one of those high things in it that has three in it all those."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","The little jets, water jets and that's what you use so you can get it high up
into the sigmoid colon and let it out there."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: what is up there a normal enema thing?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",a bag?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yeah but you do is take a little bit of the hose, put that over your....

Q: Oh okay."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: And put your big long thing on that.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: That's what you would suggest an enema bulb?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah but they don't have a long thing on it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A lot of people were having
trouble getting it high enough up in there."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And when its not high enough up in,
it keeps coming out."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: It works for me.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: It works for you, good."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Then you have a short rectal area.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You know some
people have a really long rectal area."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: How far is that gonna get up into the large colon?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: What you do is get on all fours and put it in.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Or, if you are in the
shoulder stand, and you do it in the shoulder stand then you don't have to move
anywhere."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",You just keep your legs up in the air or put it down like this.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If you
put your legs down, and your knees go up around your ears or even here."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You are
putting pressure on your intestines."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You are not allowed to move very much, so
your legs are up in the air more."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And your torso is straight with your hips,
then roll your stomach and that will move the fluids up the descending colon."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And then also that will fill up the transverse colon.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And then after you do that
for three or four minutes or four or five minutes roll on your right side, get
down on the floor and get on your right side, lift your left leg up and roll
your stomach, yeah it will move it into the ascending colon."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And that way you've
filled it all over so that that bacteria in your colon is going to get all that
fresh fat that it would never get otherwise."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So you'll be feeding your brain and
nervous system like you never did before."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: And rolling on your stomach is better than massaging?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yes, massaging isn't just going to do it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Could you just do the high egg too to get the fat down there?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: You could do the high egg yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Instead of just...?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: But no that won't go to the bowel......just right in your system.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Predigested, it goes right into the system."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: It doesn't wait to go to the bowel.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: It's all absorbed before it gets to the bowel.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Same with high meat, its
gone, but its already in a form to feed the brain and nervous systems."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It
doesn't have to wait to get o the bowel to get to that breakdown point."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: okay.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I thought you were saying if you do the high egg it gets to the bowel
because it would.....

A: No no, you don't have to get to the bowel."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Eggs will never get to the bowel.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Even high?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Even high, no."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Even high yeah, no matter what form they are, they'll never
get to the bowel."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: All in the small intestine.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Right.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: So it goes in the small?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Assimilates in the stomach and the small intestine?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",But only about five.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If you're eating eggs alone, that only goes to
about five inches of your intestines before it all absorbed."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: So now what does the small intestine, if I'm really constipated and getting
its nutrients from the....

A: It's in the food, fresh food."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","By the time it gets to the colon, almost
everything is absorbed, the fats, everything is digested."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So the bowel is going
to feed your nervous system, and it's very deficient."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So you notice that if you
have mentally challenged infants from vaccines - I have one of those....where
everything was swollen all over the place - and you know she had no cognitive...
She was basically a vegetable you carry around."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And I told, I suggested to the
mother that she give the baby, because the baby was constipated all the time, no
matter what she ate."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","This diet or any diet because that bowel was trying to get
everything it could."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And it couldn't do it, couldn't get enough for that baby."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So I said, just get a little two ounce bulb.....for babies, you fill that with
the butter and the cream."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Not coconut cream for the baby.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And I said, squirt
that in her rectum, before she goes to sleep at night."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Holding her up side down
at an angle like this, rock her like that to move that stuff down, and that baby
changed in three months."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: She had to do it everyday?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yeah, well we don't have to do it everyday."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",That baby needed it every day.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Every body need that....it's always dry

A: Absolutely, every body, I mean I move regularly."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And you know I've got a
pretty good acute mind and awareness, but when I do that suppository."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I mean my
perception is much greater, everything is much greater."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Could you tell me that formula?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Three tablespoons each.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Butter

Q: Butter

A: Dairy cream, Coconut cream."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Okay

A: Quarter teaspoon of honey."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Right

A: Now if you have my product list, it is on page 9 of the product list."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Last time I got coconut cream was yesterday and it was really bad.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Bad how?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: It expanded out the top, it was sour."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Maybe it's just already fermented.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Just remember fermented is better; it is
predigested."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",It just doesn't taste as good.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Just awful

A: Yeah, tastes

Q: Two weeks ago it was fine but yesterday it was really bad."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I mean I-

A: You got it from Marilyn?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I turned the top off.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",It didn't want to come off.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","The minute I took it
off the top, it goes pointed up about an inch and a half."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: … didn't get refrigerated right away or something.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: so all fermented is predigested and just-

A: Predigested is even better

Q: … because he and I got round and round about this because it's like 'ugh,
now the milk is sour I don't want it'."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",But I'm saying 'it's better for you now'.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yes, but you should have said you should wait another few days till it
starts to thicken."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Because at that early stage you've got a soured bacteria that
turns it quite bitter."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And then it takes another day or two and that bacteria's
finished and the other bacteria that makes it sweeter."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Sour sweet taste....sweet
sour.....

Q: Pro biotics right?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yeah that's what

Q: Whatever your buying....so then at that point do you shake it and blend it
with some honey and its kind of kefir if it's in the fridge?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Or do you have to
make it warm and different bacteria?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I mean, at that point how are you going to
drink your milk if you want to drink it because I blend it with honey and....

A: I just drink it, I don't give a shit what it tastes like."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I've been so ill
and so sick and so painful in my life I can eat almost anything, if I know it's
good for me so....

Q: First of all, when it kefirs when it's warm - because then you never warm
the milk its in the fridge....

A: Well, just remember when you are eating anything cold its going to go
through the intestines with less digestion, less separation."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","When things are
sorted and separated better when they pass through the intestines, the easier it
is go into your body, to be able to utilize it in the blood or lymphatic system
or in the neurological fluid."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: So the kefir - take it out for a few days and then put it back in the
fridge?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yeah, once it has thickened, then put it back in the fridge and then you can
drink it cold."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",It's all predigested but still.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: The cold still....

A: The cold still will absorb fat."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You can eat it cold if you like, but a
tablespoon every minute."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If you're on a hot day, I've done that."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I chilled my, I
refrigerated my kefir or milk, and I'll only take a tablespoon at a time."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But
leaving that cold milk in my mouth cools my brain and cools my body."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: … because you're not gulping it down

A: Right."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You're not gulping it, because that will cause a traumatic effect."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You'll dehydrate, you'll absorb foods that get right into the blood stream
without proper digestion and separation."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: I still need to nurture milk shakes.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Sometimes I just want to gulp

A: That's you going too long without drinking anything."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: And drinking something isn't water?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: No.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Like you see, I'm a little baby, I've got my baby bottle around all the
time and as soon as I know that I'm slightly getting dry mouthed at all."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Keep your bottle.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Sometimes in a lecture or a workshop, I'll lose it and I'll find myself
sipping."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I take every advantage, every minute I'll sip some until I have to,
you know for 15 minutes, so I get that in and going for the next two hour phase."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","See - I can do those workshops, I can go 10 hours without stopping but my poor
audience is going.....

Q: Now see; I've had cheese twice and cramping is still there."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But when I eat
an egg...

A: It goes away?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Then you need the fats to sooth those parts of your intestine.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But you
should be... …you know if you have an ulcer like that, because that indicates
an ulcer."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Well, I used to have an ulcer when I was 18."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: You still do have an ulcer, if your having that; you still have an ulcer in
your intestine."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: That's what it feels like.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: So eating milkshake helps make the mucus....because that's not going to heal
that mucus."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Also eating about a cup of cabbage juice every four days will heal
an ulcer."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Green cabbage not red.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Or white cabbage.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Whatever you wanna call it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: I want to have a group discussion about how people eat when they travel.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I
read what you said about what you eat when you go to Hawaii."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If I want to go to
the Caribbean or I want to go to Mexico, or even when I just go back east, I
just always have to make everything up."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I ship it; it cost me hundreds of
dollars."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And I can't digest a western diet, because pretty much I'm eating a
primal diet."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So my question is, how do people travel, how do they eat?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","That's
what I want to know."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: I do the same, if I'm going somewhere where I don't know what the food is, I
ship it ahead of time."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: You ship it?!
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",It's hundreds of dollars.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yes it is.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: You know then it's.... you can only be gone like a week or something cause
then you run out of the food....

A: Well, by the time a week has gone by I have sources."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: So where are you finding your sources?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Unless I'm going to Antigua or one of the Bahama Islands, you know, that's
cultured and manicured."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Yeah there's nothing on those islands because there's
the king and queen of England that own them."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You know they keep them completely
trimmed and polished."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It doesn't matter what government it is, like Aruba is
owned by Holland."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So they keep that island at their.... that is where Hollanders
go to vacation."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So they keep it pristine, there are no farms there; there's
nothing except tourist attractions

Q: So you search out farms etc."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",wherever you are going?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: … except if I know its an island like that, then I make sure I have
shipped the food there."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I have one guy, I have a patient that is in Aruba and
that has his food shipped every week from Amos Miller in Pennsylvania to Aruba."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: shipped into Mexico or something, they probably won't let it come in."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: If it goes through Fed Ex, it will get you anywhere."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Really?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yep

Q: Now I heard Fed Ex radiates their packages."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: You can't radiate all those packages - are you kidding?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","There are very few
irradiated."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Usually if they're passing out of Los Angeles, they may radiate
them - or San Francisco...a major city where there might be some problems with
so called terrorism."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: And it'[s a fact that if they go to DC they always radiate them.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yep.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Okay so no body else here travels?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Well when I fly, like I've been going to Asia."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","When I go I take anywhere
from 20 to 30 pounds of butter with me, I carry it on."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Plus I'll have three
quarts of milk to get me there."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Do they irradiate your butter, how do you-

A: No I have a note from the doctor."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Still....

A: I give them a letter."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: My letter didn't work

A: That's funny because you're the only person."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I just had my publisher - with
his wife and his infant three months old – who just went on a cruise."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","They
flew to Miami to get the cruise, and they took my letter, they took through a
whole gallon of milk for the baby."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And lots of butter, they had a whole, they
each had a cooler that they took on; they didn't scan any of it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: But you do?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",You get scanned?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: I tried, I tried a letter and it didn't work, they didn't accept it and then
I complained TSA and I got a letter to correct it that all food will be
radiated."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It doesn't matter if you have a letter or not, they have it in writing
so.....

Q: Switch to his airline."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: It's at all airlines.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: How is that you carrying the milk on?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: I carry the milk on, that's right."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: So who's the letter to?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Do you write your own letter or?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: No I have an MD who writes my letters.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Because...... somebody who could write a letter for us?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: I write the letters for my patients but I don't write them for myself.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I know, but do you have a form letter that you could write for us?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: No what I do is charge a hundred dollars that will last you about four
months."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So I have to put your name, I have to look at your iris and determine
what to say about you so that it's honest."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: They accept iridology?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: I don't tell them its iridology.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I tell them what particular things you've
gone through and why radiation would harm you."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So I've only had two people that
it didn't work for, one was Michael and one was a psychiatrist. ["
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",laughter].
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Radiation is one issue.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",The other is getting through security.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yeah well, that letter.... if you want to get liquids through you have to
say you are diabetic."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Really?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",It's still radiated then though?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I thought you do have to have it
radiated, its not just a letter."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: As long as it's only one time.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Right because.....

A: One time is fine."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I tried it after two times and I get nauseous.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So after
the one time no, but that's hand carry on."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Not your luggage; if you put it in
your luggage, your going to get a hundred times the radiation of an X-ray."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: (mumbling)

A: So you don't put it in your luggage, it's hand carry."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: There's more radiation in the luggage.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Oh, huge....

Q: Somebody was telling me... When she goes to Hawaii she sometimes has Amos,
sometimes some of those other ones, send her - stamped - in a little five dollar
priority mail..... like teas and other like."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It's not milk but you can send
cheese through the mail."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",They make those little packages today.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: It depends, I don't send it through regular mail."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Regular US USPS radiates a
lot."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: They do?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Fed Ex only in major, only in a few major cities."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Do they have the mailers Fed Ex?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Come up with cheese?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",What about UPS?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: UPS is slower.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Sometimes they don't get it there and a lot of the time they
break shit."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: But they don't radiate it or...?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Sometimes.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","In those major cities, I wouldn't have to."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And there's certain
sizes of packages."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: How does it work?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: They'll radiate it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",That's what they do.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","They open, they put a stick over
mine, I open all of my jars and they'll put a stick over it if it's liquid."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And
then they'll put a little drop on there and say okay it's fine."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","One time-

Q: UPS?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Pardon?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: I was talking about shipping something through UPS?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Okay, they scan?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Uh no, can you open something for UPS so they don't scan it?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I would have
thought."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You know.....

A: No, they don't have time for that."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",They don't take time for that.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Yeah, when you're taking the hot bath you put all these things in it so it
neutralizes the water....

A: The poisons in the water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Not the water, the poisons in the water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Yeah, apple cider vinegar to get the poisons

A: Out....

Q: When you're done taking the hot bath, is there any reason to rinse off with
the toxic water?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: No.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: It's better to just get out right?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: That's right.. Dry off.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Dry off.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Yeah that's what this lady has been telling me.....get right back out of
there.....she wants to rinse everything off, and I said “why would you wanna
do that when you just put more toxic water on you”

A: No, it's better to just towel dry and get the-

Q: Isn't that a bit messy though?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Pardon?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: It leaves your hair a little bit messy. …...
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",you can rinse your hair.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: No I rinse my hair off in that water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It's not a problem, unless I'm putting
too much coconut cream in it..

Q: Yeah

A: Then its very oily....

Q: Okay."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: And you can put less coconut cream in it if you want.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I like my hair oily so
its not a problem with me."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Its the look.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Just a dab of coconut cream or oil?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: In the bath water I'll put three tablespoons of coconut cream in it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Yeah, right, that's what I mean."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",So you should bath not shower right.....?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I
mean....you shouldn't shower at all but.....

A: Well if you have the whole....if you have a three tiered huge water filter
system, you could probably get away with showering but you're not going to get
that heat in the body to help you clean under the skin as well as clean the
outside."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Yeah no kidding....

A: … because that's what really needs cleaning."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: And that soaking is that just pouring the toxins when you clean, your just
pulling the toxins from the deepest....

A: You are perspiring out from under the skin."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: From the lymphatic?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Well the lymphatic system dumps its waste in the connective tissue under the
skin and it takes perspiration to remove it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So that's why I tell everyone to
have a hot bath....every day.... especially if their lymphatic system is jammed."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Now I don't have a bath in my new place.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Chase took over the house from my
landlord because he didn't pay the mortgage; I was overseas when that happened."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And they didn't tell me.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So I get back, I get home and there is an eviction
notice on my door."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And it's past the date to answer the court.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So I went to the
court anyway, wrote this 15 page brief and the judge wouldn't even read it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","He
says “I can't do anything about it, it's past the date,” I said, “But they
didn't, they had my email address, that's where I told them to notify me”, he
said “They don't have to do that, all they have to do is post it on your
door.”"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",That was it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So I had to sneak into my house every night for ten days
until I found another place to live."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","They wanted me to go stay in a hotel or
something."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I'm not going to stay in a freakin hotel.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So I broke in the house
every night."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",For ten days.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Until I found the place.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",No bath tub.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Wow.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: So I sleep with seven hot water bottles.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Hot water bottle here, hot water
bottle here, and hot water bottle here, here, here, and here."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And one for one
side of the head."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: How do you keep them there.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Well, I've got a system."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I've got beach towels, I've got two under me and
then I wrap them around."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: You don't turn over ever?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah I'll sleep on my side.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I hold onto the towels and they'll roll with me,
and of course I'll move the hot water bottles to the back and front at the same
time."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Mine drift all over the place even when I wrap myself.... I actually wrap
myself with a sheet..... I have it where its this wide and that works

A: But the sheet is slipperier than the towel - yes?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Towels are not very comfortable to lay on, they're bumpy."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: To me it doesn't matter.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","when I lived out doors for three years, I slept on
rocks, on roots you know, you don't find any soft ground when you live out doors
and you are traveling every day."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Rarely did I sleep on flat ground.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I had rocks
jabbing into my ribs."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",You learn to sleep through it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: So a few little bumps from the towel, I think you can....

Q: I'm beginning to wonder what the objective is of being on this diet."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: The objective is to be able to do what you.....to be healthy.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Not to suffer
in disease."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Yeah

A: You may suffer socially."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",But to me that's not painful as physical pain.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Some
people decide that's not for them, and I have no judgment about that; let them
be that way."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","They don't mind physical pain, they would rather eat their donuts
and Hershey bars and whatever it is.....

Q: Glutton for punishment."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: That's their choice and I don't care, that's fine for them."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I won't do it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I'd rather not have tastiest food and have better health and be able to be alert
and produce."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",For a whole week I've slept two or three hours a night only.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And
I'm productive my entire waking hours."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And if I get sleepy - like I'm working at
my desk - I'm not going to go lie down."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I'm not that tired; I'm just sleepy
eyed."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",So I'll nod off right there for ten or fifteen minutes.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Then I awake and
I'm completely alert."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And I love that you know, when I was ill all I could do
was groan and moan and couldn't think, couldn't do anything you know."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And I
don't want to go anywhere near that again."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I'm getting as far away from that as
I can."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",If I only have to sleep ten minutes a day I'm happy.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: If you relax enough through the whole day to

A: Yeah no problem."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: So if you're sleeping a lot, you are toxic and need healing?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If you are
sleeping a lot?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Oh, yeah, when I'm going through a detox a cold or a flu, I will sleep up to
about six hours."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: But if you're sleeping a lot, its probably a sign or something."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: You're resting, your body's taking care of other things; it can't afford to
be physical, uses nutrients on a physical activity."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Too deficient?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Too toxic?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: If you've got a lot of toxins, you know your body has to deal with the use
of nutrients, deal with the toxins."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You don't have time for physical
activity.....not enough nutrients for it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: But then you're kind of bloating in them.....that's why you should take the
bath to get it out?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yeah or the hot water bottles, yep."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Just sleep

A: Got to get rid of it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: You'd be bloating with all the poisons.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Well, normally you wouldn't have to do that but we have a lot of plastic
fats, hydrogenated oils, which are plastic liquid plastic in the human body."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","The
molecules, they dehydrate, collect little balls of fat, I mean plastic fat."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And
what happens is it starts blocking the system so you can't perspire those
poisons out."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So you got to get into a hot bath that's a 105 to 110 degrees for
90 minutes a day to get that to move."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And if you don't, your system holds the
poisons into the body, it swells, swells, and swells."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","That's why you see in
people nowdays - their lymph system is very blocked."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You see them getting bigger
as they get older, just blow up like a balloon."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And look at your black people
who lived on margarine; it's the worst stuff of all."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","They could never afford
butter so you know they got Crisco and they cooked with that and you see these
fat people that are swelled so big."

A: You have to understand that those who are healthier have better reactions
unless they get blocked."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So their bodies are detoxing and diluting the poisons,
which it should do, but then they can't get it out of their skin."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","They stop
perspiring."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: That's the problem with being too thin?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Well, when you're too thin you're still detoxing your poisons."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You're still
detoxing and getting rid of your poisons-

Q: Really?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: But you're not eating properly, to get the fats in there to bind with the
poisons."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",But at least you're getting them out of the skin.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: When I do the 90 minute bath, half way through I re-heat the water and get
back in and my face gets so hot, because the first half, not so, because I guess

"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Is
that okay to be really hot...?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Wonderful.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: I usually take a fan and do this.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: That's okay

Q: ...put atowel over it or something?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: What I suggest is taking a cold bowl of water with ice sitting on top so you
have ice water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And you take a cold rag...somewhat moist.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You put it on top of
your head, and put your wrists in not with your fist closed tightly so the water
gets inside for two minutes and the whole body starts tingling to the brain."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: You put ice in your hands?....is that what you are saying?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: No, you're putting your hand in the bowl

Q: Oh, in the bowl ...

A: And of course the ice cubes are going to hit you here."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So you've got your
hands here and you're going to hold them for a whole two minutes."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Not easy to
hold in; it's harder to stay in that cold water than it is to be in the hot
water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And it chills the body to the brain and then your bones and that's
your.....you don't give a shit about the bones."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Its the lymphatic system, the
skin and the blood you want hot."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: And then on top of them you could put the-

A: The cold yes."

Q: But its actually good to be hot if I can stand it to it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yep.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Absolutely, if you can stand it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: It doesn't shock you to the cold, it doesn't shock your brain?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Oh and then it makes you want stay in that water all day.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Oh

A: You know, you don't get that heat prostration."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A lot of people can't stay in
that water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Yeah

A: It raises the blood pressure to much."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And you know, the brain gets worried
about it, maybe having an aneurysm or something."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",So you cool the system.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: So you are not cooling the lymphatics is what your saying at the same time?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Because its mainly the bones that.....are hit, cold is travel up through the
bone to the brain where you've got this cold thing here on your skull cooling
your brain."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",The brain doesn't like to be hot.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Right

A: The body loves it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Oh....so you put your hands in ice water is that what you're saying?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yeah, in ice water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Up to how long?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Two minutes, two minutes."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Just do it for two minutes?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Two minutes.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Any more than two minutes and you're not going to be able to
stand it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: I'll try it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",What do you think about mineral hot springs?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Wonderful!
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Oh okay..... Or mud.....the only thing is they chlorinate their water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Some

Q: Not all of them."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Which

A: Which ones don't?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: You ever hear of those desert hot springs?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",They don't have them.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","They
changed it every day."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: They flow through..in California you have to have the flowing only.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Like the
one in.....

Q: Glenn Ivy?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Glenn Ivy!
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Glenn Ivy has one that they don't chlorinate.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You have the
swimming pool; you have the one that you walk into and then you've got the mud
bath over there and then you've got all the others."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","That one that's near the mud
pool - there's no chlorine in that."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",The pool has got lots of chlorine.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Three
sectioned right there at the foot of the swimming pool: NO chlorine, no nothing,
but they have the constant water flowing through it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And the one with the clay
in it, they don't require them even though its not a continually flowing one."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",With the clay in it they don't require it to be chlorinated.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Every other pool on there, every other hot tub on that property of Glenn Ivy is
chlorinated."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But if you really want a good place to go to a hot springs where
its constantly you got different temperatures and you're outdoors go to Deep
Creek."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Where

A: That' where, you know where Hisperia is?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: You go up 15 to Hisperia.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You get off at Hisperia, you go the Bowen Ranch."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It's about 20 miles back in the mountains, in the San Bernandino mountains."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Then
you get off at Bowen Ranch, you pay like 5 to 7 dollars for a day and you can
camp out there, they'll let you camp."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Take tents or whatever and then you hike 2
miles to the hot spring."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Isn't that on the cliffs....?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yeah, you are on cliffs but you climb down into it and you have to cross the
river."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If you go in the winter, you will freeze by the time you get to the other
side and you have to move fast."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It's cold because it's got all the ice run from
the snow drift, and ice water coming off of Arrowhead and Crestline and all
those that fill that river."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",So you've got from about here to that fence.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","That
much cold water to cross."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And if its late summer time, its shallow."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Not a lot of
water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",But in the cold time it's deep.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And you've got to get through there and
sometimes I... It is so cold sometimes your body's muscles stop."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And then your
barely swimming across it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",You know it never comes up over here.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But still
that's, when its ice cold water, its really freaking cold."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But then you get to
the other side, you've got all these different hot springs that are coming off
the cliffs."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You got different ones, you've got one called Arizona that's right
against the river, and its got rocks all around so you get in and it's a shallow
one about this shallow."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So you're getting into this hot spring, put your hand
over into the cold water, you can go from one to the other."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: And it isn't chlorinated?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: No this is wild, this is natural."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And you're not allowed to spend the night
there but you do it, I've spent the whole week there and I don't go there on a
weekend cause rangers will ride in on horses and they'll ticket you."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","85-120
dollar ticket."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: If you stay there just for a day?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: If you stay for a day its fine.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: What's the name of it?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Deep Creek....and they've got this one that's up there on the hills, up on
the cliffs."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And you get up there and its deep, its like 7 feet deep."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Sand on the
bottom and rocks, It's fabulous."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And you could go naked, its far enough away."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A
lot of people go naked, a lot of people won't."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But if you go there on a weekend
there are too many people."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","They smoke, they burn candles, so weekends not a time
to go, you know if you like more quiet and privacy."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Week days are phenomenal.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",All different temperatures.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",There's some flat elongated ones.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","They are sectioned
off into different temperatures."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","See it gets the hottest up here and it cools as
it comes down."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And it feels a deep one over there and there's another one down
below that and they run off into each other."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","The one that says deep, you can
dive off ten feet, twelve feet down into the water and swim."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I don't suggest
that men go in that naked because I got a catfish that bit the end of my penis."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And it bled and it hurt.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So if I go in that naked, I have my hands on there."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","When
your swimming around they don't do it, but when your sitting there in the cold
water you know its like in summer time they go.....

Q: Those cat fish...fish in the river waters, they go right up the penis, what
are those kind of fish?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Oh those are in the Amazon.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Yeah, nice."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: They like the warmth, they go right up and embed themselves in the urethra."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",But they'll go up there in a woman too....yeah....if you pee in the water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If
you pee in the water and your penis is exposed then it will go right up in it
while your peeing."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: So woman too?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Even woman yeah....they go right up in the, they follow and love the hot
water, and they go right up in it and they get lodged in there cause they have
spikes... so there was the, they did document that, cause a lot of people say
that's a fictional story."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But then this one doctor said, you know I didn't
believe it I thought it was all fiction until this one guy came to me and sure
enough it was in his urethra."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I had to cut him open and get it out.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Oh my God that small?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yep.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Oh they're long.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Yeah right.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: They're about this long,

Q: What kind is that, a catfish?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: No.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Isn't it called a penis fish or something......?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","[laughter]

A: I forgot the name of it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Me too.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah its an odd name.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Just the two things that cause bipolar, and where do you get the coconut
oil."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Bipolar is not really a single condition.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If someone is hyperactive,
it means they produce a lot of physical hormones for physical activity:
adrenaline, testosterone, estrogen."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Those three create energy for the body to be
physically active."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So a lot of the people who produce a lot of those need to be
physically active."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If they are not, they can get hyper and high anxiety."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Exercise is the remedy when you are at that end of the bipolar.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If you are
depressed that means you have low bacteria in the colon."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And you're not feeding
your brain or nervous system."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So that's either eating high eggs, high meat, or
doing those suppositories with the fat."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Kefir as well, would that help?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Not really, not for that."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: And the coconut oil?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Coconut oil; I get it at Thai organic life.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: So it's coming from Thailand?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah its coming from Thailand.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Phuket.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Phuket, that's gonna be a lot of shipping."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: But you know I still get it from them because they are the only ones I
trust."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: How many do you order at a time?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: I order two liters at a time.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Just two?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: But you could get a whole group of you together and.....

Q: Just for oil pulling?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: I'll eat a tablespoon a day.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Why not just use coconut cream?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: I do mostly but sometimes I want oil just to get in there and help clean
something.....

Q: You just swallow it or just.....

A: I'll put it in something."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Like what?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Like in my fruit meal or a milk shake.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Like a tablespoon.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: In Marie Enig's book, she talks about how people stimulate the metabolism
with coconut oil, is that true?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Marie Enig, she wrote the book on oils."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Any oil will do that; any oil is mainly for detoxification or for energy.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: There's a coconut oil that I should throw away because I didn't know it
was.....

A: I didn't check on it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I don't know.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: It's not fermented, it's not the way you thought it was."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Then its high heat.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Then I shouldn't even....I should throw it away?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah I wouldn't eat it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Just give it to some poor person.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And something will
be good out of a homeless person; give it to them."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","For somebody it will be
better than what they are already eating."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Okay homeless alright.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: That's what I used to do, whenever I had something that was not good enough
for me, I would give it to the homeless..

Q: Because I was using it to wash the dishes, I'd put it on my hand."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I better
not do it anymore."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: I doubt that when it's..... I doubt they would move into your skin if you're
using it to wash."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Well I'll give it to a homeless.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: So, does it help with the metabolism and losing weight?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: It could but not necessarily.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Oh.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Your meat is the thing, meats going to do that."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You've got to have proteins
to burn the fats."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",More oil isn't going to help you burn fats.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But if you're
trading off and you're not eating any oil, I mean eating butter or cream."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And
you eat coconut oil, you will lose weight because its going to start taking off
your butter and your cream out of your body, all of the animal fat."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It's gonna
start ripping it out."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Good or not good?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",What fruit meal do you use again?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",What....?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","What fruit
meal are you talking about?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: I just told you, I’ll have it with a milk shake or a fruit meal."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: And not with the vaccine formula,

A: No I don't have it with the vaccine one."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Not with that, the mercury vaccine formula."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: I have coconut cream with that.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","The reason for that is, coconut cream like
dairy cream has mainly water soluble fats."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Now nobody ever talks about water
soluble fats because they are so fragile."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","At 105 degrees, they're all destroyed."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A lot of them are destroyed or are altered as it goes to 96 degrees.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","That's why
I don't like coconut cream pressed above 96 degrees."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Now most of your vitamin A
and concentrated vitamins are in the water soluble fats."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Only 7% of anything is
oil, 7% of your vegetable juice is oil, 7% of coconut cream is coconut oil, now
you take a look at the composition of a coconut, its 80% fat."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But only 7% of
that fat is oil."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And 93% is water soluble fats.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: So what is the fruit meal you use that you take this coconut oil with.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: It doesn't matter any.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I don't care, anything."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: an avocado, an Orange?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: You could eat it with avocado or an orange, absolutely anything."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: ….
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",my question about the bipolar... what foods would benefit that?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Exercise for the anxiety, cream to help calm the person and the nut formula
or lots of cheese frequently to help lower the hormone level."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Okay

A: Okay?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But for the depression part of it, high meat, high eggs, suppository."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Okay?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Yeah I have a rough time getting enough raw butter in my diet, you know I
just can't get over the taste of it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: How about honey with it?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",It's because you lack enzymes.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Right.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Right that's what she's been doing.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Then just have the smallest amount of honey that it takes to digest it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Or
eat it with some pineapple, little chunks of pineapple, you know with little
chunks of blend pineapple and butter together if you like."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Don't let it sit
because it'll, pineapple will start breaking down the butter, it'll start
tasting like that milk when its off in that center area."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Exactly, because you don't want to have pineapple with coconut oil."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: You can....: And coconut cream....what did I just say, I said you can have
the coconut oil with any fruit except for the vaccine formula, okay."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Vaccine....you may have it with that, but you may go through a hell of a detox
with oil in it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Could start vomiting or diarrhea.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: You know, I don't want to go there."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Then I can't function.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I know my
diarrhea and vomiting, I liked them, but I don't like the extended periods of
it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: I shattered my knuckle years ago, dropped a piece of ply wood on them you
know and broke it, my big toe knuckle on my big toe and just in like the last
couple years, its getting a big knot in the top like calcium deposit or
whatever."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Is it hard?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Or semi soft?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Like rubber like bone?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Like bone yeah....

A: Then it's calcified, I mean a mineralization."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Doesn't always bother me but I don't know, seems like when I get stressed
out or something, just once in a while it just burns and it really really.....

A: Your body is trying to dissolve it if its burning."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","What you can do is take a
piece of pineapple rind and put the fruit side on it and wrap it....

Q: Yeah....

A: But don't do that more than once every three days cause they will eat into
your skin and burn your skin but the bromelain will have absorbed into the skin,
and just do it over night or four, five hours at a time."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: What about soaking it in lighter vinegar with water?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You like.....

A: Its good."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Yeah it helps the whole foot.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: So you can put it in, you can put a hot water bottle there too with a
pineapple, put the hot water bottle on the side and you've got the pineapple
here."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Wrap it in a towel so it doesn't move - so it stays on there for a whole
night - and that will help it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I have several of those in my foot because I had
a bicycle accident."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I hit the curb - I was going in the desert on my bicycle -
and somebody had let the water run in the curb, in the gutter."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And mold grew
just overnight and I had no idea that it was like that."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","My tires just slipped
right from under me."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So this foot caught the edge of the curb and ripped these
toes out."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And each time it split the skin all the way back about an inch to two
inches."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And broke seven toes, I had seven breaks."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I had two breaks up here and
then four toes broken."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And it was bleeding and a mess.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It was terrible, and the
toes were all broken and I said, 'Oh I can't go to the hospital, they won't do
what I want; they're going to want to sew up in between the toes, they're going
to want to do all this stuff."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So I thought I know this fourteen year old girl
who would love to, she'll go over and crack your knuckles."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Oh yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: She loved to crack knuckles (laughter).
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Ow!
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: So I went to her house.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I brought the bicycle to her house in that shape, in
that condition."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And I waited for her to wake up.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","She had one of those long days;
she stayed up late at night."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","She was a 14 year old girl; her mother didn't
discipline her."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","In a different way, just let her have her way."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But still a good
girl."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Very good girl and so when she got up, I did that and got up at 6 o'clock
in the morning and she didn't get up till 10:30."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Oh no.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: So it's like suffering all day waiting for her to put my knuckles.. and she
looked at that and said “I can't do that!”"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And I said listen, “you crack
knuckles all the time, I would let you crack my knuckles anytime you want but
you have to crack those in place first.”"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So it took about 30 minutes to psych
herself into it and she put every one in place."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Oh my God.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: So I went to the movies, just to keep, I watched Caddy Shack. ("
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",laughter).
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And I rode a bicycle 12 miles because I had to get my mind off of the pain.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I
couldn't just sit there like when your waiting for, it was excruciating that
seemed like two days even though it was like 4 hours."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I went to Caddy Shack, I
bicycled all the way, with that foot in that condition."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I watched some movies
and then got into my sleeping bag that night, put that out on the desert."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Next
morning, 90% of the pain was gone."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And I bicycled, all the way out to the farm
to do work."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I was 20 miles, 22 miles I bicycled the next day."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Would the pain formula help with that?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yeah but I didn't have all that....

Q: Felt better.....Yeah how did you heal the skin?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Oh, I put lime juice."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Oh you did have that.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: So I packed lime and I put mud on it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You know I got some good mud, clay,
and packed that on it, sealed it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But my toes, you'll see that the toes on this
foot are more spaced out than this one."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",You see this is more out and spread?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Anyway, I had a lot of bone spurs like you have, that I put the pineapple with
hot water on."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",In a year or two they went away.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Wow.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",You put pineapple near the swelling on your toes you said?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: No, where the bumps, the bone growth was, where the extra bone growth."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Also
lipoma, I had a big lipoma here and I put the pineapple on that."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And gradually
over time, that went away."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Does anyone remember the little white mold I had on
the eye lid here?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Nobody noticed it?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Bright white!
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I thought everybody saw it,
but nobody saw it except for one person."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I had it for a whole year and a half.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Recently?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Well it went away about four weeks ago, I had a heck of a flu and cold, and
then I looked in the mirror, one day its there and the next day it was
completely gone."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Just disappeared in one day.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I thought how great!
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I thought it
was going to come off a little at a time like a wart."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Just gone the next
morning."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: You didn't do anything?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Didn't do a thing to it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Wow.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: I threatened to take a little exacto knife and cut it off.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I said 'no, I have
to see what happens, what my body does with it'."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And I'm glad I did.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I mean - no
scar, no nothing just disappeared - on the next morning it was gone."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: what did you put on it?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: I was, I didn't put anything on it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","That one I just left, because it's in
the eye."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",It was right on the top of that lid.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Oh!
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: So anything I put there was going to go into my eye.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So I wasn't going to do
anything with it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: That egg white thing you were doing a lot.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: No, that was when I was having that acid from my tumor here, drifted into my
eye and scarred eye, I used egg white a lot there because it was so painful."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Can you use egg white just to clean out your eyes?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yep.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You have red eyes, put it in put it in."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Eyes, there are a lot of actors
and actresses that use that because they put that stuff in their eyes and it
gets rid of it but it causes vision blurring problems."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So they just use the egg
white and it takes the red out of their eyes, and you can go right for the
camera in two minutes."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: You can use butter too?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Butter will cause the eyes to be red.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: If its fresh can you?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Even if its fresh....

Q: Okay.....

A: You can always do it as a butter at night, and that will strengthen the
eyes."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Oh okay

A: Yeah

Q: I used to get these white bumps on my forehead

A: Pineapple."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Well......

A: You need bromelain to help break that down."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Okay cause one time I just took a pen, and I wanted to see what it was made
of."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yeah

Q: It's like a hard cholesterol fat."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: No it's not cholesterol, it's plastic."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Oh okay.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Plastic.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Yeah, and what the pineapple does is - the bromelain eats away at
the skin that surrounds it and causes the skin to come up with that to peel it
off."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: I'm cool.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Prick it off because you have to dig down to get it because once the plastic
sticks in there, it won't move without something to cause it to raise and the
pineapple will cause it to raise."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: So this question, I probably asked it before, we talked about it a little
bit, but just for the relief of the arguing, about water, we have this on-going
thing, he knows cause I'm dehydrated."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",So he's like you need to drink water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And
I'm like I need to have all liquids which I'm not doing lie juice or milkshake
or the mineral waters."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But he's thinking 'well you need more water' and I'm
saying 'no' I wouldn't be.....

A: Well look how much water your retaining."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: yeah I'm retaining water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: You had dehydrated.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Your cells are not getting the fluids they need because
your cells cannot absorb water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Plain water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","There has to be all kinds of
nutrients bound with it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","That's why the more water you drink, the more you are
thirsty."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Oh

A: … because it dries the system."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Kidneys, she was having pain, her kidneys were hurting and stuff and just to
drink some more water, just kind of flush it out."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: That will make it worse because that will dry it, what it does is it gets
the mucus off the kidney lining."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And then the kidneys are very vulnerable.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It
dehydrates the kidney cells so it makes the kidneys worse."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","That's why the
medical profession tells you to do that if you have kidney problems - then
people end up in dialysis by listening to them."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",So that's not a remedy.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You need
milkshakes to get the mucus going to coat the kidney."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: So talk about the water in general.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: You don't have dehydration, you're not dehydrated at all."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Yeah because we don't need something to drink to be not dehydrated.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Right.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Could you put it into a kind of simple form?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Well you need water that can be absorbed cellularly.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Everything you eat has
mainly water, even meat is 55-70 % water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: If it's raw.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: If it's raw, yes."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Once you cook it, you fractionate the ions and the water
is released."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Then your water is separated from everything.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So are your nutrients
separated and cauterized and not even a absorbable ordigestible."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But milk is
86-90 % water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Fruits are 93% water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Everything is majorly water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But you have
all of these enzymes and vitamins and water soluble fats."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Everything that a cell
needs to be able to utilize H2O. H2O is just a way to transfer the nutrients."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Its not the end product its after, in fact water by itself is bad in most
instances."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: What happens for if you drink it in the bath?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah but see your skin.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",You see what happens to your skin.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: What?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Your skin is not supple, it's still very dry and you've been eating this
diet since...

Q: 15 years."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah 15 years.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Yeah but I have the moisture drink every day.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Doesn't make any difference if you drink a lot of water, your gonna dry
yourself out."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: So just take a sip or two like once in a while or what do we mean?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yeah, take one tablespoon lets say every five minutes if you're going to
drink water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",But no more than let's say for most people.. I don't drink water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I've had, well he came into the house for a week, so I've had probably a cup of
water, uh not quite a cup, three quarters of a cup of water in the last week,
but never more than one and a half tablespoons at a time."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I hadn't had water for
a full month before that."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Even in the tropics.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I don't drink water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Even when you're working?....But your breaking down all your......?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: I drink milk and I'll take - if I can't get milk - I'll take the coconut
water and medium ripe coconut meat and I blend those together."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So I'm never
drinking water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Or green juice?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Green juice yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: And sport drink.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: But two sips if I have more than a cup a day, four days in a row, stops
digestion for me."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So I'm down to one, two cups, three cups a week at the most."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Like my nephew - he's in the military in the summer and they force them to
hydrate all the time while they're......

A: And what happen to that one military fella six years ago?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","He died from
drinking water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And it really, let me tell you, what they do to the military,
the military is to brain wash you and beat you physically into a pulp so you
listen to everything they say."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","They give you at least 18 vaccines when you enter
the military."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","That means you've got 8,000 times the toxic of a dose of mercury
for a year and your doing it in one day."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",They shoot you with that 9-12 shot gun.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: And they do 18, so nine in each one, bam!"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Bam!
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You've got nine, that's 18
vaccines in five minutes."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","The amount of poison - that's why a lot of those
recruits die or they get very sick."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",That culls out the real weak ones.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Then the
rest of them, they do that to shorten their lives because if you are a vet, you
get benefits your whole life."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","They end your life soon to cut down on the
benefits-paying."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",They pay out.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","there's a reason, for all the damage that they
do."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And you know you don't see the senators and their sons out there, except for
once in a while, going out to the war."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Hmm...

A: They won't shoot them up with vaccines."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","To get to be a congressman, a
Senator, he wont get 18 shots of vaccines."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Your not required to get anything.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So

all around that first."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",You notice that in any elderly person; this goes first.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And that's because all the fats are being pulled out of all these cells to
handle the poisons coming down the gums into salivary glands."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So you put butter
in your mouth, you put cream in your mouth and you just let it after you do oil
pulling because you may have to pull out a lot of toxicity."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Or after a meal, put
your butter in your mouth - the coconut cream in your mouth is okay, but butter
and cream is best."

this black guy, a homeless guy off the street and make him a better stock broker
than their best stock broker."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So that was taken off a real incident on these two
executives with Coca Cola."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I couldn't remember if it was Pepsi Cola or somebody
said it was Coca Cola."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",They did some research on it too.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But one bet the other
that he could sell water for as much as Coca Cola."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And the other guy said you
can't do it, so they made a bet."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",But it was a million dollar bet.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And the guy
started in 1961."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","He started getting doctors together and reports together,
paying them to put stories up about you need 8 glasses of water a day, before
that we never drank water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","We'd go to the fountain at school, and you take a sip
a day, the athletes would maybe drink a half a cup of water a day from the
fountain."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Every variety drink, orange juice and milk."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Orange juice and milk,
that's what everybody drank."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",They didn't drink water until they started that.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Then by late 60s everybody's drinking water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: I work a lot outside and stuff and sweat and get to that point where you
just don't want anything but water you know."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah but that's a problem.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",You can't absorb that water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Right.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: So I've got athletes who go on a quart of my sport formula for a whole five
hours."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Tennis players, they go on one quart

Q: Can you make it without of the pulp?"

"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: I've got champion tennis players and other athletes who will drink a quart
of that in five hours."

tennis champions are 2009, were both my patients."

"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Could never play sports and they were
both champions number one, you ask a whole country champions."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","That was Walker
Kerher and Valerie Misik."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","What they do is, they took a quart of that and there
competitors, they're drinking down water and they're getting weaker and weaker
and weaker."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Cause its diluting the nutrients in their body so its diluting their
adrenaline, its diluting everything."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And they're just sipping on their sport
drink, that one quart takes them all the way through that five hours."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","On top
every time."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I have champion marshal artists in world competition.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","One quart of
that sport formula take them all the way through."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: It's like that Indian tribe that chased the run, something unbelievable."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: A hundred miles.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: A day.....

A: The Andes in Chili."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But they kick a wicker ball and they'll have nine in a
line, and they may have a hundred of those lines and at all ages - even 90, 100
year old men."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","The first one kicks the thing as far as he can and they're very
good at it because you''re on a narrow mountain trail."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And they'll kick that
wicker ball, they'll kick it away, that person falls back behind, next one kicks
and they just do that the whole way."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And that keeps them entertained so they
don't get bored with running that hundred miles."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Up the hill, they've got some kind of a, its not a beer drink."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Its a fermented coconut mixture.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Right.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: … because a coconut is 80 % fat and it's 15 % protein and 5 %
carbohydrate."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So it's the exact ratio of fuel when it, fat when it burns and
[unintelligible]."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",So it's perfect for activity.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Of course you can only do that
for that hundred miles because then your body starts using your animal fat."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Then
you're in bad trouble."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","The men I know that do the hundred mile run in this
country, take two bottles of aspirin to get them through it and they're drinking
Gatorade and water the whole time."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And they don't go out of the house for two or
three weeks afterward because taking that much aspirin, your skin takes all the
Vitamin K and U out of it and all the vitamins."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So their skin will act like
toilet paper and just peel away, so they can't go out of the house for three
weeks."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: You said aspirin?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Aspirin, they take aspirin to be, they're in so much pain they can't run a
hundred miles without some kind of drug."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So they take up to two, some of them
take up to four bottles of aspirin."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Oh my God, so all these other athletes, like Olympic athletes, they're
drinking water and Gatorade, but they have superior genes or whatever."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: And they have these extensive hormones that are not normal.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Yeah, like ones eat all that junk, all day."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",But those people usually die young.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: They're one in so many people

A: Yeah but they die young."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Yeah they don't last.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: No like McEnroe, you know how skinny he got?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Yeah

A: At the end

Q: Yeah

A: He couldn't play anymore."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Billy Jean King got so dry and dehydrated from
drinking all that water and playing; they couldn't exercise anymore."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Now both of
them are fat but they're still alive Those who never got fat die of aneurysms or
a heart attacks in their forties and in their early fifties and they're gone;
you never hear about them again."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But you look at Mcenroe and Bill Jean King and
their fat now."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Since following a good diet.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: No.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I don't know what diet they are following.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","McEnroe is probably doing
some of my diet because his coach has been on my diet for sixteen years."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: To do honey butter they.... the liquids are coming your fruits and for meat,
everything."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Everything.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: If you're raw, then your getting the water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: All of it yep.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: H2O. And the minerals so you get the package deal.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: For everything.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: That's what I'm trying to explain.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I can't explain to people, because that's
the toughest one to get through."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",It is not about water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: It's about the nutrients that water carries with it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Oh, okay."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I see.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Water without nutrients is no value in itself.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: But what about mineral water?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: It is still water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: After I do the 90 minute bath, I have a craving for mineral water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: That's because you're not sipping the sports formula all through out the
bath."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I sip a pint through half of it and I drink milk the other half.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: And you're sipping it all through?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Your not gulping?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Probably drinking it a little faster, but I don't gulp it.....

A: Yeah well, if your drinking it fast."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","a lot of that is going to rush to the
kidney."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Then you can have all these nutrients within without water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Then you're
going to crave water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",But getting the two to couple again is very difficult.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: So what do you...its just hard to sip stuff.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: You put a straw in it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Whatever it takes.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I use a straw.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Its plastic isn't it?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: The straw has been used many times so is ok.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Also I get glass straws..

Q: Where do you get them?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: … over the internet.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Glass straws.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Glass...

A: If I used a plastic one and soaked it in water - good water with lemon
juice - and then cure it in the sun, it would be okay."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And then as long as you
are not putting hot water or ice water through it, that straw and everything...

Q: That forces you to sip?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: … barely room temperature.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Oh, I use some very fine straws."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And then you
suck and it's like all this bacteria comes into it and it's like so satisfying
because if you're gulping, you're not getting all that bacteria."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Really

A: It's like a baby - you pour the milk down a baby and you don't have them
suck it, they'll be belching, they'll be regurgitating all kinds of gas so when
they have to suck they get all this bacteria and saliva with it which digests it
and they're very satisfied."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: I do have a huge craving for mineral water after I do the bath

A: And that's why your skin is still dry."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Me too.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: You don't see my skin dry.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: So the edema, how do they get rid of that?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",That's from toxins pulling?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: It was diluting toxins under your skin, you need those hot baths."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: The bath that draw the water yeah like....

A: Melted out of your system...

A: Yeah, you need a 90 minute a day."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: And that pulls out the existence of edema the best?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Is there anything else?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: No.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","There's nothing - well, grapefruit helps you eliminate excess water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: You got the lymph baths with pineapple mixture?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Oh that pineapple that doesn't help withedema.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","That helps you break down the
toxicity and the congestion in the lymphatic system."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: So could that replace the hot baths with the pineapple?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: No, you've got the plastic fats in the body, plastic oils in the body that
are jamming it; they don't move unless it's 105 degrees."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And even if you're
exercising you never go above 100.8, 101, if you can ever get that hot."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Athletes, marathon runners, still never get above 101 degrees."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Just can't get
there."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",You need to get to 105 degrees.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And stay there for 90 minutes.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","110 is
wonderful if you can take it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Beyond a 110 you damage your skin.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Is it okay to drink grapefruit juice?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Well, it's better that you eat the grapefruit."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You've got bioflavonoids
sitting there."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And if you eat only the grapefruit juice, your going to irritate
your kidneys and bladder."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And if you have the bite slabs cause it.....

Q: You mean just take that in....

A: Little B Vitamin, little B1 Vitamins in it, so that it soothes the tissue."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: So have that in your bath?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",What are you saying?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Take that....

A: No, no, no you're eating the grapefruit."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Your eating the rind a little bit to.....

A: You mean the white in there?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Well there's plenty of bioflavonoidsin the
fruit sacks."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: You have to have a fat like that, just by itself....

A: Its always, preferable to have fatswhen you have fruit."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I say always,
always, always have the fats with fruit."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You know some people eat an avocado,
then even eat a piece of fruit like a citrus that has sections in it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I'll eat a
section at a time, maybe then eat a little more avocado or eat a little butter
or cream."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And I'll drink that and then eat another few sections.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Do it that way.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Back to the grapefruit, just make smoothie out of that with eggs and....

A: Then yeah, if you have eggs in it it will help, and cream, you will use it
in a way, you can use it as fuel."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And still don't drink it fast.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: No, no

A: Just remember, when you drink stuff - when you gulp - most of the water is
going to go right into the kidney and then all those nutrients have no way to
get to your cells."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So it causes dehydration because the body wants to replace
that water; its impossible."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","By drinking water, you cannot get that ion activity
between the nutrients and the water again."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If you took water and you blended it
with some cottage cheese, put a little honey or fruit in it, you will get it to
reconstitute the water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Not all of it 100% but you will get it into a shape
where its more like fresh food rather than dehydrated."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Rehydrated, it will
nutrify you

Q: … cavemen back then when all they had was meat and streams to drink water
out of the streams

A: They didn't have to drink water, they weren't polluted."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Oh

A: Well, you have the jungle animals, you have wild animals, dogs that never
see water for months till it rains, then they'll lap some up when it rains."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But
they'll go months without."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Elephants go six months without drinking water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Camels go two months without drinking water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Most animals do not drink water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","The only animals that normally drink water on a regular basis are birds because
they eat so many dried foods, seeds, grains, and bugs."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Bugs have a lot of hard
shell."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And they take more water to help break down.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So birds drink water, but
they're built for it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",They have a system that handles water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Even dogs and cats?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: No dogs and cats are not supposed to be drinking water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","The only times they
drink water is when you feed them dehydrated garbage food."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Okay, so my cat I always feed him raw meat, he still loves the water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Well you should be feeding him raw milk.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: He's not crazy about it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Good.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Well get a dabber and make him eat it anyway.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Okay, alright."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Don't give him a choice.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Right.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Then put a …, cats are very finicky; they don't like sour milk usually."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Some like kefir, so you only put enough down till he won't eat it anymore and
then you dump it, cause you won't force him to eat that."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Yeah

A: And the milk should be warm, room temperature."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Then he'll lick some of it,
and you'll see he'll only need to take five, six licks a day."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: He loves the cheese though.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah that way he will need more fluid.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: He's constipated

A: … because of the cheese."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Remember, dehydrated food is going to make your
water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But if its going to do that, you should have milk or a sport formula,
something with still 95% water."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",But still has lots of nutrients in it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: I was amazed, that sport drink you made me, what was in it?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It was just real
basic."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: That's what I'm saying.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","That's what my construction workers use and my
athletes."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Watermelon in the summer.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: My friend was asking about the benefits of drinking urine

A: Urine, the reason people drink urine, is to recycle their proteins, and most
people drink their urine are vegetarians or lacto vegetarians like in the far
east."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You have in India, you have the worship of a cow, because it produces
milk."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It's a feeder, they will not kill a cow."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If they're truly religious, if
they're Hindu."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",But they will drink the milk.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But they don't get enough proteins
so they'll drink their urine to recycle their proteins."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And it works very well
on that kind of diet."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","On the Primal Diet it doesn't work because you're already
getting concentrated proteins."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","However once in a while, if your feeling
imbalanced and your feeling off, just in the body and nothing you eat is
stabilizing you like meat usually does, then drink urine one time."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But the
fiction, the worst fiction you can believe is you drink your first urine in the
morning."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",The most toxic urine you produce is produced in the morning.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You know
if your going to recycle your protein, you need it six hours after you have
eaten a meat meal."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",That will be your highest concentration of protein in urine.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So six hours after you've finished your meat meal, that's the time to drink that
urine if your going to drink it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Or right before bed time.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If you are an
athlete, you don't want to have it at that time, you want to have it mid-day,
after you have your first meat meal in the morning, somewhere around 1, 2
o'clock."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You have your urine, and its best to drink it an hour, two hours before
you have your fruit meal."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",But urine on this diet is not necessary.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Right.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Right.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: It can still be, for some people."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Some people have genetic diseases, like
they call maple syrup a disease."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Where there are three to four amino acids that
you don't digest."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And it causes the muscles to malform; babies who get it, die!"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",They just melt and die.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",It's a serious so called genetic disease.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It has nothing
to do with the genes - it's that you poisoned the body so much that the gene to
help digest and utilize that amino acid is no longer there because of
contamination, vaccines or the parents eating a bad diet ."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Too much salt causes
it in some people."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So there are some people who don't digest, even though
they're on this diet, all of their amino acids."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So maybe once a month, drink a
cup of your urine."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: How do you know if you digest right?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: If you feel grounded and you're stable and you are down to earth, you're
doing fine."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: What if your spacey?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: If you're spacey, if your easily irritated, you're likely not digesting,
utilizing all of your amino acids."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: So its anger also related to...

A: Most anger is an over-productivity of hormones."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: And its not burning......

A: No amount of exercising, yeah....they're not spending them."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So they go into
high anxiety and spend it that way."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: So all of a sudden someone has an anger outburst, because you're emotional,
or it is....

A: Well, emotional is linked with that yeah."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: … linked with not exercising.?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yes.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: adrenaline and anxiety?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yes, the anxiety comes from not exercising."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Precisely.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: … because a lot of people are like, psychological; you're saying that."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","The
physical comes frist and the psychological."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Always.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Always.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Look at all the babies born to the tribes people.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","All these
babies are laid back and happy."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Not crying all the time and fussing.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","The
children obey the parents, everything is easy."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Once you give a kid a vaccine
when he's born, you can better believe that's a difficult child."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","That's why they
are vaccinating children the day of birth, with the Hepatitis B vaccine!"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: I know.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: So there you've got a difficult child, you know that child's not going to be
mindful."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",It is going to be a pain in the ass.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","My mother came from a family of
thirteen children."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",She's one of thirteen children.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",They all got along.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","They all
worked together."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",They all got degrees.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",But they all were raised on raw milk.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And
raised in a warm climate, Alabama."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You know, so they had everything and they
weren't poor."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",My grandfather was a drug pusher.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","[laughter]

He was a pharmacist."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And they owned a drug store, so they made their own raw
ice cream."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And they sold that at the drug store.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So they grew up healthily, so
of course they got along."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","What happens when we came out, the next generation?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Poking us with tetanus shots, gave me a tetanus shot my first tetanus shot at
three months old."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: That's what causes the autism?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: I got autism at 18 months old from my first tetanus shot; they created it
purposely."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: I just want to know why the world can't understand this.....that news
is.....why can't you put it out there?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Because they don't believe it, they don't believe that people are evil."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Oh, when is that going to come to time?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Never?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: When they're dying and becoming extinct.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: All of the animals have it....they have to be vaccinated when they're born.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: All according to law, all cats and dogs have to be vaccinated for rabies.:"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You can get a vet's dismissal,

Q: Pardon?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: You can have your vet tell the license people, 'this dogcan't have it'."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: And I took my cat, he got into my car....and I told the vet, this is a feral
cat, I don't want any shots given to him."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","He said 'no problem, they don't work
anyway and they're damaging'."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Good vet then

Q: Yeah, I have the funniest infections on my legs."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I tried the cheese and it
was helpful but on the calf, and the upper parts of the leg, it seemed to be
getting worse."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Its scarring.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Well.... it sounds like you've got something like mercury coming out, if
it's that bad."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And it's picking a particular area at a time,."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It gets so scarred
it can't scar anymore."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Are you taking the hot baths?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: I don't understand that.....

A: No."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Then you're going to exude and cause damage.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You need to get through
that skin fast."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If it's hanging up in the skin, it's going to do damage while
it's in the skin."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Do hot water bottles if you can't do the bath.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Put a hot water
bottle here and a hot water bottle here."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","This leg... And one on this side will,
on each side of this leg, wrap it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Kathy.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",let me talk!
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You're trying to second
guess me all the time, listen and I will tell."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Put hot water bottles on each
side; wrap each with a towel, keep the towel, keep them on there."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Don't put
extra towels on there because you'll perspire."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It'll come out the skin without
being hung up in the skin and you'll do less skin damage."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","That's your next
experiment."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: I guess.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Too fast with the hot water bottles, you're just saying here, here, here,
when he goes to sleep."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: No, he's exuding some toxins through his skin, causing sores and irritation
and scaring, The toxins are hanging up in the skin and under the skin causing
damage to cells, causing all kinds of degeneration."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If he puts a hot water
bottle on both sides - because he's got dryness and soreness here; put hot water
bottles here, hot water bottles here, wraps this one in a towel, knees in a
towel so he's got two hot water bottles on each side - that leg is going to
perspire already quickly."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And he'll be perspiring in long johns and something
cotton, to absorb the poisons."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Or you put the towel first, then hot water
bottles, then a towel around that."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Pajamas

A: Pajamas are fine, as long as they're not synthetic."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: They're cotton

A: Cotton, great, that will absorb the toxins."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Richard had all these red splotches on his forehead up here.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","What should he
do for that?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I've been putting papaya on it.....

A: No he's got rosacea."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","That means his blood vessels are rupturing in his skin,
so he needs vitamin K and he needs cabbage juice."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Green cabbage juice, half a
cup a day until it stops."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Now with the heater you talked about... Should I leave it on from morning
till midnight, or all day never turn it off?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: I never turn mine off, I like warmth."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Leave the house so we just leave it on.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: I leave mine on 24/7.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Even in the summer?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: No.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: I didn't understand but...

A: That was for hot, it's for making it really hot."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If your house is cold, than
make it warm."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: And how if I'm too sick, with the heat, I don't like... I can't breathe."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Turn it down.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Turn it down?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Turn it off or turn down.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Turn it way down.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Turn it off

A: That's fine."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: But now with the winter, you want to leave it on running all day & all
night."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Unless you make it too hot.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If your going to make it too hot, turn it off."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: You're not talking about forced air are you?No

A: No."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",We're talking about condensed radiator type heat.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: What should I put it on, what temperature?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: I don't know the kind you have.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I have four settings on mine.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: It's just a knob, you turn it with wheels....

A: There's no switches to give you high and low with that knob?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: No.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: You just turn that until you find aone, usually half way is good."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: And you're talking about, alright you get out of the bath, you put hot water
bottle here, here, here, and here."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: No cause you....

Q: What I get at, I just have the hot water bottle here."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","That's all I have it
here."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Kathy, what I say to people is, if you want extra heat to melt out the
poisons, put one here."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: One here?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: One here.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: One here......

A: One at each hip, one under each arm."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","One under one side of the head, next
night the other side."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: That's what I've done.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Seven hot water bottles.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: And where do you buy those that are de-...?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: There's a product list

Q: How do you hold it onto your arms?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",You've got to go like this?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: No, you don't."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Let's say you have a towel over it, just, if its under there,
you don't have to go like this."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Just relax it, its going to stay there."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It's not
going to run away, it doesn't have feet."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: The main thing is the legs and you put on each hip here.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: If you're lying on your side, either side."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You put a hot water bottle here,
hot water bottle here, and you wrap them against you in a towel."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Hold it with your toes?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: What did I just say?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I said if your legs are together and you're sleeping on
your side, you put one here, wrap a towel around the whole thing right there."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Here, around over here, when you have one on your stomach and on your back."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I
use a pillow at the back to hold them against my back, and a pillow at the front
so I could go hot water bottle here.....

Q: One at the stomach?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Kathy!
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Listen.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Put a hot water bottle here and hot water bottle here.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Okay,
so I've got a pillow holding them against me."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Behind me I have another pillow
holding against my back."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And then there's one I'll have here that goes this way.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I don't do it this way.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I do it this way, but I'm laying on my side."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Pardon?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A. … because that's pressure.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Heat and pressure too can break capillaries and
blood vessels."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Okay.....

A: In your face and in your eye, you got that thing rolling from your eye and
you got swelling cause of the heats expanding and everything."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You could pop some
vessels in your eye so I don't do that on my face."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Only use one hot water bottle
on my head sometimes."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Why are you putting all these hot water bottles on?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: To melt down the plastics in your body

Q: Instead of taking a bath?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Well, you can do both if you want."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Yeah....you'll sweat more.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: If you want to, yeah, if you want to get rid of those poisons faster, do
both."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: I can have both on my head.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: No you have one on your head

Q: Yeah, here, right here."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Whereve

Q: So this will replace the lymphatic baths?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Or a reasonable substitute?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: It won't get it thoroughly because the heat is localized in certain areas.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You've got lots of lymph glands here, in here, in here."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","That's why I favor that
area."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Those areas.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",So that plastic will get melted.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But you've got plastic all
over the body."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Nothing will get you so evenly heated with like water will.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: So its like a second bath.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Helpful.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Helpful yes.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Not nearly

A: Not as good."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Yeah okay.....

A: But still helpful."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: You're doing the outside of the legs, or the inside of the legs?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Well, when I'm on my back or stomach its the inside."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","When I'm lying on my
side its on the outside."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",These are front and back.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: And you have to move things around it at night.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Take it off and put it here
and there?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Well, I can go from my front to my side."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I've been doing it so long, I can
move my legs in a certain way and I can take it from the front."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And flip it to
the back just by a certain kind of turn."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So I know how to do it, and you'll get
good at it if you do it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: But it has to be in the inner legs.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: No.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","When you're on your back or your stomach, that's the easy way to do it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","When you're on your sides, it has got to be your front and here."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You're not
going to have it here between your legs."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Front here.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Front or back.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: So it has to be on the top of this leg.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Okay, you've got a lot of sores at your shins, not as much as in the back
and your calves."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",So you should put your hot water bottles at the shins.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Shin is here?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Shin is here.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",This is a shin bone.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: You put it on top here.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: You need it on top; other people may, but I put mine back here,.because I've
got all the insulin from when I used to shoot up insulin."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It caused all kinds of
lumps and everything."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","This is if somebody massages me, the only place I have
pain is in my calves."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",So that's where I'll put it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Why is there.....how do you detect it?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Insulin, here, here, yeah but you have to understand that's synthetic, even
if that's from a pig, they still process it."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So its not really a pure insulin
anymore."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So out of about - let's say the glycogen that it converts - it converts
22 - 25%."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",That means 75 % or more of it is toxic.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","And it stores; that's why your
diabetics have amputations."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: I thought it was because the sugars compromise the blood flow to the...

A: That's the bad insulin."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Your diabetics - who are pure diabetics - they can't
walk, they can't breath; they'll die that way."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But it's the insulin that makes
the poor glycogen, that stores in the tissue."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","It is a high acid, so it causes
deterioration of tissue; it degenerates tissue."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",And then it goes into gangrene.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: But you're talking about also this top leg that has to have two hot water
bottles on

A: One......

Q: One on each side."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: No...one...one in the center.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Center.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Okay....?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",If you're lying on your back or stomach.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If you're lying on your
side, you've got one here and one here or one here and one here."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If you've got
problems in the front put them in the front."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","If you've got problems in the back
put it in the back."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Just over here?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: If you want, you could have two more hot water bottles, so you could put one
here and one here and one here and one here."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","One here, one here, one here, one
here."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",So then how many do you have?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Seven then

A: No you have more, you have two extra."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",So you've got nine.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Oh nine.....do you submerge your head when you take baths?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Or is that not
necessary?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: When I had a hot tub I did.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: You don't have a lot of lymph in your upper part

A: You mean here?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","All the way around here, all the way around here you do."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So
when I had my hot tub, my face was out this much."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Okay. …
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",.But you can't do that in the bath.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",It's not possible.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Not unless your legs are out of the water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: You say your brain doesn't like to get hot.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But you have to do that
sometimeswhen you submerge."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: But I couldn't stay in long like that.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",with my head under water.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Do you still do that?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: I have no bath tub.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I said I have no bath tub in my new place.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Oh you have to get a.....but you did until last April.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A. It has been a year.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But I spent so many years... I slept in my hot tub four
to six hours a night."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I did my sleep periods in my hot tub.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Ah...so that hot tub you're talking about...

A: Yeah a big hot tub."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Ten feet in diameter.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: So you just kept....

A: It was cement yeah."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: You just kept the water...reused the water then?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yeah

Q: Oh....

A: I used the water for probably about three months."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","But I had a filter system
and the heater on."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I had a big three hundred pound sand filter.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Wow

A: And that takes care of the swimming pool."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","So I had the hot tub for thirteen
years and never changed the sand once and it kept crystal clear."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","I'd put coconut
cream in it, I'd bathe in coconut cream in it and it would be all murky, turn
that thing on you know the filter on and it would be gone next time."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: You said you let the algae grow...

A: Yeah, the algae."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","The water would stay crystal clear but...

Q: You said you let the algae grow though."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Yeah, on the side."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: You find someone to make or put together system for a hot tub.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","You said you
were looking for something, remember I was in touch with that friend of mine
from Vale."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: Well not for me, for other people."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: Well I know, but have you found somebody to build that pool?"
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Not reliably.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Okay.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Yeah.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",I need to find a plumber who is on the diet.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",That's what I need.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Q: You ever contact that guy though, he might have been able to help you."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Oh I talked to him.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: You did talk to him?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: I talked to him.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: And he couldn't help you?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",A: Well he was arguing with me about how to do it.
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt",Q: Oh he was?
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","A: A guy that argues with you, he's gonna do it his way no matter what."
"Q&A_Of_February_3,_2013.txt","Just
like Sharon Palmer, she's gonna go the way she wants to go."

Three doctors declared that I would die at age twenty-one after I had received medical treatments for cancer."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I began searching, experimenting and exploring other means to gain my health."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The high point of gratification in my work in the health field is the saga that We Want To Live; Volume One, Out of the Grips of Disease and Death tells."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It is the battle I waged when the doctors said that my son was on his deathbed.

Friday, September 26th
“Hi, Mom,” I say groggily. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Are you okay?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We usually talk on Sundays.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I peer through the curtains above my bed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It’s a clear early morning in Beverly Hills, California."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I wonder what in the world - or in Cincinnati - happened to get Mom to call on day
rates. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff was in an accident.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“How bad?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“His car went into a ravine and he suffered severe brain damage.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He’s
in a coma.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“No... I’ll be on the next flight.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“The doctors say he won’t live through another night,” she hesitates."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“There’s no point in your coming...until it’s over.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Why would Mom say such a thing? “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If there’s anything I can do I
want to be there.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Mary doesn’t want you here.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“She actually said that?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“She told me to tell you not to come.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“If Mary and I could have done what each other wanted we’d still be
married."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ll call you as soon as I’ve booked a flight.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Okay.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"We’ll pick you up at the
airport.” “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Thank you.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I love you.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I love you,” she replies sincerely and hangs up."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Oh, my God, I’m going to have to face the helplessness I felt when
Jeff was an infant and I was seventeen."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And the divorce with Mary at nineteen.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I feel delirious.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I flip open my personal phone directory and punch in the numbers.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The lines are busy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A recorded voice answers.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I check my pulse rate.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It’s faster.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Although my heart and mind seem a little frenzied, I notice my adrenals haven’t triggered panic in my body."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Is my body protecting me from the inevitable?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Can’t death just leave me alone?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I won’t spend energy on that probability.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Okay.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Jeff will need lots of--

“Hi, Cyndi, what is your next flight leaving L.A.X. to Cincinnati?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This is a life-and-death emergency.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wonder how corny that sounds and how often she’s heard that line. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My son’s been in an accident.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I’m sorry,” she says timidly."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I hear her computer keys clicking away.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I drift into memory.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff was one month old.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He had my blue eyes and my fairness when I was his age with many of Mary’s facial features.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary sat in the rocker holding Jeff in her arms.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Her thick, dark brown, wavy hair folded on to her shoulders."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Her large brown eyes and full lips are flanked by high full cheek bones and jowls.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary and Jeff rocked.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He screamed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He pushed and twisted his face into the blouse covering Mary’s breast.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"His scream pressed his lungs completely void of air, creating a vacuum."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then he desperately sucked in air as if suffocating.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He released another blood-curdling scream and then gasped for air.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He screamed again and again.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Grieved and frustrated, Mary and I didn’t know what to do for him."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I’m still searching,” Cyndi’s voice rescues me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But my thoughts keep churning.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I remember Jeff screaming for hours, night after night."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I turn my thoughts to life right after Jeff’s conception.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Like normal teenagers in love, Mary and I adored each other."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She was
a senior at Finneytown High and I was a junior (she was older than I)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Our parents were understanding and supportive, which surprised me at the time."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We married in another state and hid it from everybody because the school didn’t allow married or pregnant students.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Mary did sit-ups, wore sweaters and blouses that hung to hide her pregnancy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She graduated with honors in her sixth month.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Within four weeks after that her stomach bulged to the size of a basketball.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff was born the first week of my senior year.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Surprisingly, the school faculty changed policy for me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They encouraged me to attend as a part-time student, allowing me to take only the courses necessary to graduate so I could work and tend to my family."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Very little in my life was happy until I met Mary more than two years before Jeff was born.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"All of a sudden, encouragement came from everywhere."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Margaret, Mary’s mother, took care of Jeff while I was in school and Mary was at work."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Margaret was strong, fun-loving, attractive and had reddish-blond hair."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She hated to be called a redhead.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Why, I still don’t

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"T H E P R I M A L D I E T
know."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,After school I’d get Jeff from Margaret.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff and I went home to our apartment in a lower middle-class suburb at a very small business intersection.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We lived above a “Family Billiards” hall and I remember being comforted by the happy noises of people playing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After settling Jeff, I’d usually prepare dinner for the three of us."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’d gobble down my share and rush off to work the moment Mary walked in the door from work.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She was a prized secretary for the electric company.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I breaded and fried chicken and French fries in a short-order restaurant.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I got home from work between twelve and one in the morning.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary was often asleep in the rocker with Jeff fussing or asleep in her arms.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I’d take over, hold him in my arms and rock."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,On a rare occasion I did some homework while I rocked him.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Sometimes we alternated in one- to two-hour shifts, rocking Jeff through the night."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Everybody except Margaret insisted we were spoiling him.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Fear of spoiling a child was the mindset back then.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,So several times we let him cry in his crib.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,One time he screamed for six-and-a-half hours until we picked him up.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We knew his pain was more than a need to be cuddled.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We discovered our baby had severe colic.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We gave him baby aspirin.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They made him worse when the effects wore off.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The doctors prescribed every infant milk formula on the market.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,None worked.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Everything the doctors said and did did not help him.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I wish we had known then that if a mother is on a healthy diet, breast-feeding would have resolved the problem."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The doctors steered us away from breast-feeding.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The consciousness seemed to be that breast-feeding was unsanitary, primitive and disgusting."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Consequently Jeff suffered for twelve months.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We suffered with him.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It stopped for no apparent reason.1
“The first available flight is 11 a.m. tomorrow,” Cyndi’s voice snaps me back."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Who’s going to Cincinnati in late
September?!” “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You, sir,” she quips."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I asked for that. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Please put me on your stand-by call list for all
flights and book me on the first available, please."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My name’s Aajonus Vonderplanitz.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I spell it and Cyndi’s keys clicking away takes me back to when Jeff 1 SeeAppendixA,page127."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"OUT OF THE GRIPS OF DISEASE AND DEATH 11
was one year old."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary was aloof.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"What was it about childbirth that robbed Mary of her ceaseless optimism, humor, joy of life and sensuality?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That thought constantly perplexed me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I didn’t understand that it was biological.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Not knowing enough about anything, I thought it was merely psychological."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I pressured her to desire me the way she had before.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She couldn’t.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I said hurtful things to her.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It made things worse.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,All the chores and responsibilities of family life didn’t make any sense anymore.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After work, I began drinking with work buddies until five or six in the morning."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"During the days, I attended a breakthrough computer trade school."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I got top grades in something other than art for the first time in my life.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I began seeing one of the teachers after school.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She was a single parent, divorced, eight years my senior."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She was lonely for affection, too."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Do you want to schedule a return flight?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Uh, yes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I have to be back next Wednesday late afternoon.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,What am I saying?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Am I expecting a miracle in five days?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ll have to cancel my performance next Thursday.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,No.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,If I can’t help Jeff I’ll need the distraction.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Okay, Mr. Vonderplanitz."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We’ll call you if a seat opens.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You’ll have about forty-five minutes to get to Los Angeles International Airport immediately after we call.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,So have your luggage ready.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"But for now your reservation going to Cincinnati is on flight___”
As I write down the information, I remember Jeff’s first portrait- sitting."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He was six months old.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He sat on a cloth-covered table, clasping a small rubber ball between his chubby thighs."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He laughed and giggled.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The flash blinded him and he made a mean face. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Just like his father,” Mary gibed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was teasingly blamed for all of his “bad” behavior.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Jeff was a spirited, lively child once he got over colic."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He was such a joy when he was feeling well. (
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"But then, most everyone is.)"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When he got angry he would suck in his breath, puff himself up, turn red as a beet, clasp his fists at his sides and shake. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Just like his father,” Margaret razzed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I enjoyed hearing the phrase, “Just like his father,” although I never held my hands stiffly at my sides and shook."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Even Jeff’s temper tantrums were cute, and ludicrous."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"We shared the same favorite word, ludicrous, and we gave it a clownish connotation."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Actually, it was one of the few words he spoke."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"By the time he was

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"T H E P R I M A L D I E T
two, when either of us tripped we’d laugh and say, “That was sure ludicrous, were you born yesterday?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He had a viable excuse.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Everything was cheerfully ludicrous, except the change in Mary after childbirth."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had never seen Mary violent and now she was spanking Jeff with a flyswatter and yelling at me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Often, I couldn’t blame her for yelling at me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I deserted them.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We divorced.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I thank Cyndi and hang up the phone.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I begin planning for the battle.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The enemy is huge, shrewd and powerful."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I must put the enemy at bay so I can use my nutritional expertise to help Jeff heal.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The enemy - Jeff’s body’s enemy - is the medical profession’s concepts and methods.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I get up, get dressed, eat and drive to a health food store to get the survival supplies I know I won’t find in stores outside of California.2
I reach for a six-pound jar of unheated honey and place it in the hand basket."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I know the glucose water that they are pumping into Jeff intravenously has no nutrients for healing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I know that his body is depleting the nutrients within himself, trying to heal."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ve experienced that unheated honey has the nutrients to promote healing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I reach for another jar and a woman approaches me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Do you have a tribe of sweet tooths?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,she flirts (or am I flattering myself?).
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She is definitely attractive.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Her upper lip is slightly larger than the lower and quivers sensuously, unconsciously, when she’s quiet and curls when she speaks."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,What am I thinking about?! “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Just two.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My son and I.”
“Oh... Have you been married long?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Boy, is she fishing."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I reach for a third jar and smile, “I’m divorced.” “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Storing up for the fall and winter?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,she asks merrily.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I eat a jar or two a month.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Aren’t you afraid you’ll get diabetes and your teeth’ll rot?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,she gasps.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Her persistence is charming, relaxing. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If I were to eat heated honeys
I’d have diabetes again and dentures,” I say."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Well, whenever I ate Uncooked Raw honey it imbalanced my blood

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"OUT OF THE GRIPS OF DISEASE AND DEATH 13
sugar level."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Like a roller coaster I was full of energy for an hour or two and then I was deep in depression or falling asleep,” she says argumentatively."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Is she a lawyer?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I want to turn this back into a conversation. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My name is Aajonus.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Pronounced like homogeneous without the hum.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Caught off balance, she titters, “Aajonus?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That’s unusual.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m Linda.” “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That’s not.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She finds it funnier than I do and laughs.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She has a singer’s airy rich
laugh that makes us relax a bit more."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I buy only honeys that are labeled ‘Unheated’, or that say something
like ‘We do not heat this honey in processing’."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Honeys labeled ‘Raw’ or ‘Uncooked’ aren’t the same,” I clarify."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She furrows her brow and looks at me as if I were a simpleton. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,What’s the difference?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,she asks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I think of the many internal and external wounds I’ve seen heal rapidly with application and large consumption of unheated honeys.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And how miraculously unheated honeys stimulate digestion. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Okay, honeys labeled ‘Unheated’ can’t be heated over beehive temperature on a hot day - that’s 92.8 Fahrenheit."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"On hot days, bees fan the honey with their wings to keep the honey temperature below 92.8° F. In the body, 80-90% of unheated honey turns into enzymes for digestion, assimilation and utilization."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Whereas, honeys that are labeled ‘Raw’ or ‘Uncooked’ can be heated to 160° which they do to thin the honey for quicker filtering and bottling for more profits. ‘"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Raw’ or ‘Uncooked’ honeys mainly turn into radical blood sugar. ‘
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Unheated’ is the key word with honey.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You can eat as much unheated honey as you want, as long as you have a taste for it.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“As one gets fatter and fatter,” she scoffs."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“That depends on what you eat and what the honey helps you digest and utilize.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,There is nothing wrong with being fat as long as you are healthy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But do I look fat?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Your metabolism is different,” she retorts."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I used to get fat very easily and I would have to exercise four hours five days a week to stay as fit as I am now.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I haven’t exercised in seven years, so I can’t take credit for my fitness."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Except that I eat right for my body.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She looks at my naturally developed body disbelievingly.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Sounds like fun.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Can I play, too?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I must seem naïve because I’m turning red.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I hand her my business card.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She reads it and says, “Now I understand, you are a nutritionist.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Yes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I’ve enjoyed talking with you but I must go, Linda."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Bye.” “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Bye...”
I walk over to the dairy section and remember that I’m supposed to
speak at a group meeting tonight about my experience with cancer."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I consider canceling as I place eight one-pound packages of unsalted certified raw butter in the basket.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I decide to go to the meeting, so time will pass faster."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The distraction could relieve some of my anxiety about not being able to get to Jeff sooner.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I glance over my shoulder and spot Linda watching me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,As I walk past her she joins me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“How much raw butter do you eat?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I chuckle, “You don’t want to
know.” “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Four tablespoons a day?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“You asked for it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eight to sixteen tablespoons a day.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She gives me an are-you-a-pathological-liar look and starts to say
something but I intercede. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Like unheated honey, although the labeling requirements are different, ‘Raw’ butter hasn’t been heated above a cow’s normal body temperature."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Raw fat, like raw butter, cleanses, lubricates, protects and fuels the body easily."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Whereas heated and pasteurized fat often store as cellulite or other hard-to-use or non- utilizable waxy fat.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I place the items on the checkout and pay. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Call me in a couple of weeks if you want to try my nutritional logic and see if it works for your body.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I think you are out of your mind,” she says utterly deadpan."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Is that a compliment, Linda?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Outside of the store, I punch in my voice-box number on the pay
phone."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It plays back a message, “Hi, sweetheart, I got your message about Jeff,” Beatriz’ voice says and pauses for the right words. “"

I feel as if my muscles, like my thoughts, are stirred up."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I can’t sleep.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I thank whoever invented flannel sheets.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The softness feels comforting.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The digital clock reads 1:02 a.m.
I rise and go to the kitchen."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I pass by my packed luggage at the door.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A tinge of fear rushes up my chest.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The lonely luggage makes the unknown so foreboding.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I spread a slice of French bread with a 4 tablespoons of unsalted raw butter to calm me down while thoughts of Jeff keep coming.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It’s been nine years since I’ve thought about Jeff this much.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,How little I know him.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I left Mary for the second and last time a few months after Jeff’s first birthday.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"For the next year, Jeff and I were together on Sundays, or for weekends."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I graduated from computer-programming trade school, and in September, two months after the divorce, I moved to Los Angeles to pursue a degree in architecture."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ll never forget the day before I left.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff’s second birthday was six days away.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had bought him a swing and slide set.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary and Jeff were living with her parents in a two-bed-room house in a lower-middle-class neighborhood.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Willy, Mary’s father, and I were building the set in the backyard."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Willy, or “Pawpaw” as Jeff called him, was about five-feet-four-inches tall with black hair receding on either side of his widow’s peak."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He was very shy, a gentle man."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When he smiled with his large mouth, his head tilted shyly, playfully."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff loved to swing and slide.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He bounced, danced, laughed, shrieked and giggled around us because he couldn’t wait for Willy and me to finish building the swing."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Finally, when it was built, Willy, Margaret and I stood watching Mary swing Jeff."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She pushed him too hard once and Jeff swung too high.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"His eyes opened wide, his arms stiffened, his hands gripped the chains tighter and his mouth made a donut shape."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He lost his breath.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When he swung back down he giggled, relieved he’d made it okay."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He dragged his feet enough to slow himself down and took a deep breath.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I guess that was too high for you, huh boogie?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary said.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff nodded dramatically.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He swung forward again and his mouth

took on the donut shape fearing that he might sail too high."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He didn’t and he laughed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary did too.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We all laughed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Mary and Jeff had similar mouths and they had the largest smiles, after Willy’s."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Once again I wanted to ask Mary to come with me to California but I knew she’d refuse.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"No one could guess which way I wanted things from one week to the next, especially me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It came time to say good-byes and I stooped down to Jeff. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You’re the man of the house now.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You take care of Mommy, okay?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“You be back, Daddy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Soon.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He smiled real big.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“No, sweetheart, Daddy’s going to the other side of the world, sort of."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ll only be able to see you about every six months or so.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m going away to school in California.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He cried.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I cried.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Even Margaret cried.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"We all hugged and I
left."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I didn’t return for two years.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I rise from the dining table and return to the kitchen.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I have a taste for
something sweet."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I get some unheated honey, fresh strawberries and cream to help my digestion and raise my blood sugar level to a happy balance."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I take a drink of the raw cream, dip a strawberry in the honey and take a bite."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I remember that Jeff and I had been together on only four separate occasions since the swing set and we rarely spoke on the phone.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I recall that the first of the four occasions was in August.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff was four.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had a form of leukemia called multiple myeloma (cancer of bone and blood).
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had already undergone surgery for an ulcer.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Three months later I received radiation therapy because the scar was keloidal.3 Four months after radiation I was diagnosed with leukemia.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was told that I would die by Christmas.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was supposed to have begun chemotherapy that August.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I postponed it until September because my family was having a reunion.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I didn’t want them to know about my illness because: back then most people were afraid that somehow cancer was catching like the Black Plague; Mom had a weak heart and had suffered a heart attack when I was ten or eleven (telling her I was dying could have killed her); and men in my family were expected to be strong and tough.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Because I had always
3 A keloid is an overgrowth of a scar, that is a fibrous tumor forming hard, irregular excrescence upon the skin."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"OUT OF THE GRIPS OF DISEASE AND DEATH 17
been sickly, I put on a tough front."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The clan gathered in Cincinnati from all over the continental United
States."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I thought I was seeing everyone for the last time.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I hid the radiation therapy burns under my clothes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As I was driving to get Jeff to bring him to the reunion, I noticed a tall dark-haired father holding the hand of his golden-haired son."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They walked along the sidewalk.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Drops of joy filled my eyes because I would soon be holding Jeff’s hand.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The father was a giant compared to his son but gentle.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He carefully moved at the pace of the boy’s little steps.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I held back more tears.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I thought red eyes would look unattractive and immature to Mary.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I arrived at the large apartment complex, parked and walked to Mary’s apartment."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She greeted me courteously.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We both felt awkward.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was especially uncomfortable because I hadn’t had enough time to adjust to the fact that Mary had remarried over a year ago.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mom wanted to protect me and had told me only a week ago.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I blushed, facing Mary and thinking that several months ago I had asked her to move to Los Angeles so we could be together."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary didn’t tell me then she had remarried.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I hid the pain, but, oh, God, I was wounded."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Jeff’ll be here any minute.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He and Ben went for a walk,” Mary said."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The door opened behind me and in walked the gentle giant and the golden-haired boy, Jeff."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“This is Ben,” Mary smiled proudly introducing her husband, and Jeff’s new father."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My heart sunk.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Ben must have been six-foot-four inches, dark, rugged-looking and very handsome."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I felt like drab wallpaper.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Ben immediately let his head drop shyly, painfully."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He left the room without a word.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I could see the fear and hurt he felt with me coming to take Jeff for the day.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff called him Dad now.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My presence was changing all of that.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I felt like a schmuck.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Do you remember him?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary asked Jeff as I crouched down to greet him.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff’s face winced as he tried to remember but didn’t.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was crushed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Here is a change of shirt in case he makes a mess,” Mary jested to break the awkward moment."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“No bag with diapers and bottles and all,” I said playfully."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I tried to

appear unaffected."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Yes, it’s been a long time,” she said somewhat scolding me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But I could see she was relieved that Jeff didn’t remember me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In my
mind I could hear her telling Ben as soon as we walked out the door, “See?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff didn’t even remember him.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"And knowing that Jeff’s not- remembering me was going to mean some solace to Ben, gave me some solace."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"At the reunion, I set Jeff free to play with several cousins, aunts and uncles."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Then, when I thought I was emotionally detached enough, I played with him."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We tossed a ball and frisbee.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I tickled him.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We giggled.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I swung him around and laughed, until we were exhausted."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It was time to drive him home but he wanted to stay.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That made it a great day.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We parked in the lot outside Mary and Ben’s apartment.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff wanted to get out with me on the driver’s side.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Just as he was about to put his arms around my neck for me to lift him, he said, “You helped Pawpaw put up my swing!”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A wave of joy passed through me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He hugged me very tightly.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“It appears Jeff’s head went partially through the driver’s side of the windshield when his car flew down the ravine and hit a tree.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The car spun and jolted him back inside.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The car hit another tree and Jeff’s head went through the passenger’s side of the windshield.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The car spun and hit the ground at the rear end, jolting him back into the front seat."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Finally the car smashed into another tree on the passenger’s side.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,His head went completely through the passenger’s door window.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"His body was found draped over the car door,” Mom’s words echo in my head."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I lie down on the still warm flannel sheets.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Will I be as unable to help Jeff as I was when he was an infant?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Will I become hostile wanting to help but not knowing how?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Will I be able to confront the medical professionals who’ll think I’m a fanatic?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff is an accident victim!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I haven’t dealt with any serious accident victims.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Yet, healing is healing, I remind myself."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I know what the body needs to heal itself.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"3
I’m in a tornado like Dorothy in “The Wizard Of Oz.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Four doctors,
who are circling around me, direct me to go with them."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I sense I’ll meet death.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Their voices sound like the ringing of only one giant gong.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The deep-echoing sound emanates from all four of their mouths, quadraphonically."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It makes my heart pound until I think it’ll burst from my chest.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It’s odd that the ringing doesn’t disturb my ears and head, only my heart."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I refuse to go with the doctors.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Suddenly they all wilt and die.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I am happy I didn’t go with them.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But the ringing continues and my heart pounds.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I become aware that the phone is ringing and I reach for it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I anticipate that the airline has an earlier flight.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then I realize it is already morning.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I lift the receiver.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I remember my dream and the fear of death.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I dread what the voice will say.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Hello.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“This is your mother.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Hi,” my voice cracks."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“It’s pouring here and I thought you should bring your boots and a
raincoat."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I have lots of umbrellas if you need one.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Please!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Mom, don’t greet me with, ‘This is your mother’ ”, I want to
say."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She seemed apprehensive, as if she were going to tell me Jeff is dead."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It scared me!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I take a deep breath and calm down.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I recall her umbrellas being flowered, bright and feminine. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Thanks, Mom, I’ll bring a coat and my own umbrella.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I take another deep breath, “Have you seen Jeff at all?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I’m waiting until you get here and we’ll all go together.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I called the hospital and talked with the head nurse.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She said the doctors all agree his signs are worsening.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Too much water has collected in his brain and there’s no hope he’ll pull through with this kind of brain damage.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She takes a breath, “I just want you to be prepared."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We’ll see you this afternoon.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We say good-bye.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"19

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"T H E P R I M A L D I E T
I have avoided Jeff since he was two-years-old."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I have been afraid of getting attached and losing him again.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Have I lost all chance to get to know him?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The alarm goes off and jolts me back to the physical world.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I rise and go to the couch.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I stretch and lean my head against the arm.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I cross my feet tightly.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I hug a pillow.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Okay, okay."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mom’s a nurse.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Like most nurses what she knows is what the doctors know.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Whether from illness or injury, medical science believes that virus and germs, like bacteria cause disease."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That is their “germ theory”.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They believe that germs are enemies of healing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The standard approach is to attack virus and germs (bacteria and other microbes) with medical drugs and poisons to stop them.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"These drugs simultaneously attack, destroy and deteriorate the body."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Drugs are like bombs, they most often kill, cripple, harm or destroy everything within their influence."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They cause subtle or obvious mutations.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The least harm that they do is create imbalances.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Medical science ignores that bacteria inspires healing and that drugs
kill bacteria, and therefore, that drugs prevent healing.4
My approach is that bacteria, yeast, mold and virus are all part of a natural process for detoxification."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Bacteria, yeast, mold and virus decompose body obstructions, such as dead or weak cells and tissue."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When the body has too many obstructions, it has disease."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The body encourages the detoxification process so it can cleanse itself of accumulated wastes that cause weaknesses, or damaged tissue in cases of injury."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They also dissolve and eliminate foreign substances, like rust from taking iron supplements."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"That is, if the body is fed the proper
nutrients during and after the detoxification processes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"For example, colds and flu are like changing the oil and flushing a car's radiator."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If the body is allowed to take its course with colds and flu several times a year, or whenever necessary, an increase in health is the natural result."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"That is, if at the same time one feeds his or her body good nutrients."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"For instance, oranges and/or bananas blended with raw eggs, raw dairy fats and unheated honey; a smoothie."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, if these cleansing and renewing processes are interfered with or stopped by using medication, the body advances faster toward deterioration, aging
and disease."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I remind myself that instead of attacking the body, I 4 SeeAppendixC,page129."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I feel comforted that Jeff’s doctors’ prognosis isn’t based on what I
know."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And that Jeff is still alive.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I will work with Jeff’s body to cleanse the dead and damaged tissues, and to regenerate new cells to replace them."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I am sitting at a window seat not far from first-class on this early morning flight to Cincinnati.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I am facing the partition wall that separates the classes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It reminds me for a moment of the wailing wall in Israel.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I feel a little claustrophobic.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Will I celebrate life?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Or will I be wailing for the dead?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I have to stop thinking like that.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I feel excited by the gravitational pull as we climb.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I notice outside the portal window that the smog isn’t too bad on this golden sunlit Los Angeles morning.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"With amusement, I take it as a good omen."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We loop over the Pacific Ocean.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The plane levels off in the direction of our destination.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The flight attendants push their carts down the aisles.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It’s Saturday, four days from October, a time that marks a measurable decline of tourists in Los Angeles."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The thought comes that I am a tourist visiting Earth.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Whenever I talk to someone who doesn’t know me about my view on health and my life-style, I’m considered bonkers."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I look around me and I see so much bodily suffering.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I feel compassion for the people I see who aren’t happy because they lack health.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"An unhappy-looking woman wheezes, then swallows three pills."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,At least seven people are already drinking or being served alcohol.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I recall when years ago I drank to relax and feel good.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I couldn’t go to sleep at night without drinking a bottle of bourbon or gin.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was nineteen years old and had been living in Los Angeles six months.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was making good money.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I yearned for Mary and Jeff, even though I knew I was too emotionally distorted to make family life work to anyone’s benefit."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,So I partied a lot and enjoyed freedom from all responsibilities except work and child support.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wouldn’t admit alcohol was affecting my work and studies and I ignored the symptoms that it was hurting my body.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It relaxed my memories and guilt.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I think about Jeff being in the hospital and I recall my advent into cancer.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It was a Sunday night in March, one month from my twentieth birthday."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I had just returned from a weekend in Tijuana, Mexico, with

friends."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was dizzy from drink.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I stood over my toilet to urinate.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I became dizzier and nauseous.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,As I collapsed to my knees I whacked my penis on the cold porcelain (I remember I had been accident prone as a child).
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A surge from my stomach curled my body and put my face in the toilet.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Blood trailed with the vomit.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The doctor pointed to a very dark spot on my X-ray, “It’s probably only an ulcer."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You’re too young and strong to have cancer.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Don’t let looks fool you.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,How do we find out?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“It’s an ulcer,” he decided, “and we’ll treat it.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After six months of drinking bottle after bottle of Maalox, I decided I
should have stock in pharmaceuticals."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Instead of being addicted to alcohol I was addicted to chalky Maalox.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Maalox didn’t have the good taste and didn’t give me the feeling that alcohol did.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was sure that if I died a chalk factory would make a fortune with my remains.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In November, I was looking upward from an operating table."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The ceiling was blurred and I was becoming unconscious from anesthetic, going into surgery to remedy my stomach ulcer."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After “recovering enough” from surgery (the doctors had said), I received radiation therapy for five or six...or was it ten weeks. ("
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My memory went into a slump during my year of cancer therapies and has never fully recovered.)
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After returning from the August family reunion, I underwent chemotherapy for leukemia for my blood and bone cancers."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,With each chemo session I got sicker.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Finally, after three months of the treatments I wouldn’t tolerate it."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That was eighteen years ago.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was only twenty- one but I remember as if it were yesterday.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“The cancer’s not responding to the chemotherapy either.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"We’ll try again in three weeks,” Dr. Goldman said matter-of-factly."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Doctor, I seem to be missing the point here."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Let’s retrace what’s happened to me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had a stomach ulcer.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had surgery to correct it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As a result of the surgery, I haven’t been able to digest anything very well."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Food seems to just sit in my digestive tract.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I have lost my sexual drive.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,If I happen to have an orgasm it can be extremely painful.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,How in the world was my penis effected by stomach surgery?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I don’t know,” he said."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I thought for a moment and then continued, “I have terrible acne (the one common problem I have never had before)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My waist line has gone from twenty-eight to thirty-four inches.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"And I have redeveloped very

painful muscle spasms around my heart."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Then I had radiation therapy to stop the keloidal tissue from
growing."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As a result of the radiation, I have burns that are mainly scar tissue."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My spine is cauterized and I can barely turn to either side and I am always painful.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I now have psoriasis and bursitis.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I have inflamed, sore and bleeding gums."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I have come down with chronic weakness, exhaustion and joint pains."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I couldn’t, and still can’t even lift a large dictionary with my right arm because my shoulder and elbow ache so badly."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My knees ache, too."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They are always cold and numb--”
“We’ll continue the treatments because there’s always a chance we can stop the cancer from doing any more damage,” he said."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Please, listen, I’m leading to something."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then I was diagnosed with cancer of the blood and bones.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I am receiving chemotherapy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As a result, I’m as pale as a ghost."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I vomit no matter what I try to eat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I can’t be away from a toilet for five minutes without a diaper.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m bloated from head to toe.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My acne is so bad that a film-director friend described my face as looking like raw hamburger.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I have only a few sparse patches of hair and it’s graying like I’m an old man.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My teeth are rotting.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My diabetes is worse.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Homicidal and suicidal thoughts plague me--”
“Your anxiety and anger are side effects of the chemotherapy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It’s normal,” he interjects."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Normal?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Yesterday, I heard one of the biology professors say that radiation, especially radiation therapy, transforms certain body substances into toxins that are cancer-causing."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Why would you treat keloidal tissue with a treatment that causes cancer?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“It’s like fighting fire with fire,” he said smiling."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Isn’t that like burning down the forest to save the forest?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“There is no other way to stop the formation of keloidal tissue or
cancer."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Disease is not nice, you can’t treat it nicely,” he argued."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I also heard the professor say that for every one cancer cell that chemotherapy kills, at least one billion healthy cells are killed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I thought about that statistic and derived this analogy: If four humans were declared cancerous to the human race, the medical profession would be willing to kill four billion people - the entire population on Earth - in order to destroy only three or four individuals."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"That’s an

“I’m trying to give you more time to live,” he said, annoyed. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Doctor,
as a result, I have cancer."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I didn’t have cancer before
receiving the cancer-causing therapies."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I merely had an ulcer.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I feel like the walking dead.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Food doesn’t taste good.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Nothing pleases me anymore.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Why didn’t you tell me my quality of life and disposition would be miserable; that I’d be a semi-invalid as a side effect of the treatments?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Why didn’t you stress that the side effects would be a hundred times worse than cancer when you frightened me into taking your therapies?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And now I’m going to die anyway.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I’m sorry.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It isn’t possible to predict how anyone will react,” he said belligerently."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“That doesn’t make sense.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Yesterday I studied the side effects in the Physician’s Desk Reference and books on radiation research.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,All of mine and a hundred more side effects are listed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You never showed me any list.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And the Physicians Desk Reference is right there on your shelf.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Do you admit that the radiation treatment for keloidal tissue gave me blood and bone cancer?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Look, there’s still a small chance that your cancer will respond to the chemotherapy.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Did you hear what I just said?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I know how you must feel,” he said."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Finally I realized that medical methods are barbaric.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Surgery is
butchering."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Radiation is burning.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Chemotherapy is poisoning.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Why didn’t it dawn on me before?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Doctor, have you ever been cut and burned and poisoned to help you get well from cancer?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“No.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I threatened to sue because the doctors didn’t tell me that the therapies would kill much more of me than would any cancer.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I would have taken my chances with cancer.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Several attorneys said the doctors would all testify that I was dying anyway and that I had signed a release.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,How can they get away with that?!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wondered.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"One month later, I discovered several successful alternative methods for healing cancer."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,All of them were pleasant by comparison.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"But because the doctors had said all the alternatives were hoaxes, I hadn’t bothered to investigate them."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Education, religion, the media and government taught me to revere

doctors."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The doctors could deceive and frighten me, slowly and painfully kill me, get paid handsomely for it and go to heaven for “good” intent."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It didn’t make any sense.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Because I was left disabled, I couldn’t afford child support."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Ben adopted Jeff.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Please fasten your seat belts.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We are beginning our descent to Cincinnati Airport.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Thank you for joining us and we hope__”
I ignore the pilot as I look over the rain-glistening, rich green landscape of Kentucky."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I wonder why it is called the Greater Cincinnati Airport when it’s across the river at Stringtown, Kentucky."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I suppose that if it were named the Stringtown Airport no one would ever fly there.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The sun emerges through the passing rain clouds.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I’m so close to Jeff, a tingling rushes over my heart and into my spine."

Saturday afternoon, September 27th
I see Mom and Dad smiling, standing just beyond the crowd as I
follow the procession through the terminal gate."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Ever since Mom and Dad stopped worrying and began trusting me to make the right decisions for myself, I have been relaxed and happy to see them."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m surprised at how much they have aged since I saw them two years ago.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Or does it seem more so because most of the people I see regularly are more or less on my type of diet?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Raw diets slow down the normal aging process or reverse it altogether. (
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Gad, I wonder, would that have sounded pompous to anyone who hadn’t experienced it?)"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Or do Mom and Dad look older because I have been reliving my past and remembering them much younger?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Dad looks - and always has looked - inherently physically stronger

than Mom."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I imagine him as a child on the dairy farm where he grew healthfully with fresh food, raw dairy products and hard work."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He is definitely healthier than his father, who was raised in Brooklyn in the mid 1800’s when it was difficult to get fresh foods in large cities."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Grandfather suffered crippling arthritis and strokes, and died in his sixties."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Amazingly, Mom’s wearing slacks."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This is the first time she’s greeted me informally at an airport.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m delighted she feels that relaxed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Looking into her eyes, I realize she has always had a stronger balanced will and more self-esteem than Dad."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I deduce that’s because, as a girl, she successfully raised six of her twelve brothers and sisters while Viola, her mother, tended their drugstore where Mom’s father was the pharmacist."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mom and I embrace and her hand automatically pats my back.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I recall being an infant receiving that caring touch.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Her perfume hides the nice smell of her body that I remember loving as an infant.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Her salt-and- pepper Orphan Annie hair tickles the side of my face and I giggle.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The hug ends and I become an adult again, instantly."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I turn to Dad and see that his wavy gray hair still has a trace of black remaining.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Apart from his large stomach he looks fitter than most of his peers.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"We hug and his squeeze feels encouraging, different from when I was a child."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"But, then, I can’t remember him hugging me after I was three."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was probably somewhat of an embarrassment to him.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I think the first time he was unforgettably impressed with me was six years ago.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He watched me give an eight-hour seminar on nutrition.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,As we drive by downtown Cincinnati nothing looks familiar to me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I try to keep my mind from anxious thoughts about Jeff.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I notice autumn settling in.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The leaves are turning.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Ten miles farther, we pass the exit that would have taken us to Finneytown."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I lived there from ages seven through eighteen.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I remember how grueling the cold weather was on me here.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Like a hibernating bear, I would have slept through it if I could have."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When I got a cold or flu, it lasted one to three months."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Daily, I would fill two to five handkerchiefs until they were sopping wet."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They made my pockets wet and me colder.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I realize how much I enjoy cold weather now that I am healthy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"And when I get a cold or flu, it lasts only thirty minutes to three days."

“Is there a health food store on the way to the hospital?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I’d like to buy some eggs, papayas and bananas.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I don’t know if they carry eggs,” Mom says apologetically. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Could we stop and see, please?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Sure,” Dad encourages."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We do.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They have eggs and the fruit I need.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mom points to Mercy Hospital.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It’s a small modern four-story building alone near the top of a green rolling hill.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We pull into the parking lot.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,In a matter of moments we will be facing Jeff.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I seem to be ready for the battle ahead.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Surprisingly, I feel calm and strong."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Maybe it is my years.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Also, because I no longer see doctors as my enemy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Doctors have not had power over my mind and body for one and a half decades.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But they see Jeff’s body as a battle ground.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They are attacking it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I will defend him.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It dawns on me that Jeff is Mom and Dad’s first grandchild.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I look at them and they look rigid, like foot soldiers wearing armor."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They are protecting their feelings.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wonder if my wisdom and strength are enough to protect mine.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I leave my blender and food in the car and we walk toward the hospital.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The smell of wet grass and drying pavement remind me of the damp day I entered a hospital for my first traumatic stay.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A chill passes through me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It was early spring, the week before my twelfth birthday."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I had had a near fatal reaction to my final polio vaccine.5 The vaccine caused an acute intestinal infection, “deadly” peritonitis."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The doctors misdiagnosed my condition as appendicitis.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I underwent emergency surgery.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The doctors found my appendix normal.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They removed it anyway. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In case it would cause you problems in the future,” the doctor said."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Now was the third night after my appendectomy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The doctors hadn’t properly diagnosed my problem.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They never did.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I still had fevers of 104- 106°.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They packed me in ice - an agonizing process - to bring down the fever and prevent brain damage.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was in tremendous pain from the shots I received every three hours for infection or pain.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Already I had had eight shots in each arm, seven high in the left gluteus maximus and

We_Want_To_Live.txt,28 Volume One W E W A N T T O L I V E ! -
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"T H E P R I M A L D I E T
eight high in the right."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was sore on all sides.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My front had surgery soreness and peritoneal
pain."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My left, right and back sides had the injection soreness."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wasn’t able to lie on any side without severe pain.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I couldn’t sleep more than fifteen minutes before the pained area exceeded the painkiller’s influence.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had to turn onto another side.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My sleep was irregular and sparse.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,There was no escaping pain or the hospital.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It was 10 p.m. when the nurse entered with her tray and needle.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She rolled me on to my right side.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It hurt and I screamed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I pleaded for her not to inject me again.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“It’s for your own good,” she preached and scolded."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I watched the needle coming toward my bottom.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I used every measure of energy I had to turn and knock the syringe out of her hand.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The syringe hurled through space twisting and turning as if in slow motion.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,In my imagination I heard a wonderful crescendo of music.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The nurse lifted the syringe, wiped the floor and left."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I fell asleep only slightly more relaxed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,In deep sleep my hip began to burn and cramp.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I remember thinking, I am not sleeping on my back, nor on that hip, why is there that much pain?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The pain increased.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I woke and felt the last fluid of an injection entering my hip.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I cried, “The medicines aren’t working!"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You’re killing me!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You’re making the pain worse and worse.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The nurse gave me a disbelieving smile.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She proudly put the needle back on the tray.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I remember how amazed I was that this Florence Nightingale could be so proud of her insensitivity and ignorance.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Have a nice night,” the nurse said and walked out."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If I had had the strength at that moment to kill her, I probably would have."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wanted to.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But instead I lay there crippled by pain.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I cried for two and a half hours.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I fell unconscious from pain.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,In the morning I gave the doctors and nurses such a conniption that they didn’t give me any more medication.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Consequently, I got the sleep I needed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I faked being well enough for 24 hours.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They let me go home the next morning.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Mom, Dad and I reach the elevator."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It opens as if waiting for us.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We enter and Mom pushes the third-floor button.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We don’t look at each other or say anything as it ascends.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"With the motion of the elevator I

drift back into my experience in the hospital when I was twelve."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,An intern stood towering over me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,His manner was impatient and gruff.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We had gotten off to a bad start two days earlier.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He had asked if I had been farting.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Since my puritan upbringing had taught me that the word fart was taboo, I was shocked to hear it come from a doctor."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I stuttered and without judgment I asked if he meant did I pass gas.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He thought I was a snob and turned malicious.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I was afraid to try and rectify the misunderstanding because of autism and my experience that
doing so merely compounded resentment."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Sit up,” he ordered like a sergeant."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I moaned in pain as I sat up very slowly.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Don’t pull that sympathy trick on me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I’ve seen too many
appendectomies."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I know the pain doesn’t last more than a day and a half after surgery.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You’ve been pulling this for four days now.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He pushed hard on my lower abdomen.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I screamed in pain.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He smiled and said, “Look."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Your buddy over here came in two days after you.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He was up and running around the day after his appendectomy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He doesn’t scream when I push on his stomach.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And he’s going home today too.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I can’t help it, it hurts."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Even when I move.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It only made him angrier.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He took my right arm which had the I.V. needle inserted in it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He gently pulled one end of each of the four strips of tape that held the needle in my arm.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He took firm grip on those ends, looked me in the eyes, smiled, and ripped the tape from my arm."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The roundness of the needle pulled my flesh until the force tore my skin.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I cried.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“You act like a girl,” he said."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I intuitively knew he wouldn’t hurt me more, so I continued crying to release the pain and frustration while he put gauze and tape over the bleeding gouge to stop it."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Two hours later I was out of the hospital and on my way home.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The elevator stopping sends a wave through my stomach.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We step from the elevator and Mom leads the way toward Jeff.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I feel nauseous.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My heart misses a beat and then speeds up, pounding."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The halls are empty, except for a couple of staff personnel."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We pass many doors.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Only a few patients have visitors.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The patients are all connected to machines.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Of course this wing is eerie, I realize, this is

intensive care, numb skull."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Numb skull”?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I haven’t used that term in ages.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Numb skull was
something my parents called me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And probably what their parents called them.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It never did help my self-esteem.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Strange how old patterns surface when I’m back here.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mom stops at room 317.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff is steps away.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,For the first time I visualize his cuts and bruises.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I see him thrust and banged around inside the car.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My adrenaline rushes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My heart pounds like a great symphonic drum sounding the battle charge.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I take a slow deep breath and enter the room after Mom.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wonder if it would have been polite to enter before her.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We pass through a small dressing room-like foyer.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It has a large picture window fixed with lavender Venetian mini-blinds.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This is the room where loved ones wait and watch while emergency personnel work.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This will be my supply room.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,On the wall is a locked medicine compartment.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,There is a counter and sink where I can put my blender to make food formulas for Jeff when he recovers from the coma.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Am I deluding myself?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I see the end of the bed, the shape of Jeff’s feet and legs under the covers."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My blood rushes faster as the drumming of my heart pounds harder, louder and faster."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I see Jeff’s arms and hands taped to boards so he can’t bend them.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Tubes run everywhere.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A catheter empties his urine into a plastic container.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,An I.V. drips sugar water and chemicals into his right forearm.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I feel queasy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I want to stop for a moment to settle down.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I keep trooping behind Mom.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I remember Jeff’s face from the last time I saw him when he was eighteen.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,His smile was big and his complexion ruddy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The image disappears when I see two machines monitoring his body.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Mary stands on one side of the bed, at the head, facing me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"A nurse stands opposite her, obstructing my view of Jeff’s face."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They lean over him.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Now I see his chin.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,His mouth gapes open.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,His lips are gray-purple.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Oh, my God, he looks dead."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Oxygen tubes are strapped to his head and up the nostrils.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,His eyes are closed and recessed in unconsciousness.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"His skin looks waxy, ashen except where tubes enter his body, irritating him."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Cuts spot his face.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A long cut streaks his forehead.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Another parts an eyebrow.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The abrasions from the plunges through glass are swollen

OUT OF THE GRIPS OF DISEASE AND DEATH 31
and inflamed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I take it all in for a minute.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I use positive thoughts to settle myself.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I
think: Jeff’s not missing part of his head, brain or limbs."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m thankful for that.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My heart continues to drum frantically.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wish other instruments would join in so no one would hear it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It could expose my sensitivity.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I want to look totally in control.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The enemy will know that I’m not as strong as I want to be.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Jeff!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Wake up, Jeff!"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You’ve been asleep for six days now, wake up."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Your mother wants to talk to you,” the nurse shouts as if Jeff were deaf."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I guess she wants to shock him from his coma.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Okay, I guess, if it works."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But it doesn’t.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff’s head seems to roll slightly as if he were trying to tell her that her shouting hurts.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Or is that my wishful thinking?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Six days?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I whisper to Mom.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Mary didn’t call me until the night before I called you.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You weren’t home and I didn’t want to leave that message on your answering machine,” she says firmly."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Why did she wait to call you?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask with a trace of anger.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Fortunately, Mom does not take it personally."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“She figured there was nothing we could do.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When they told her Jeff was definitely going to die, she called.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wonder why Mary still hates me after twenty years.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Jeff!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Wake up!”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,screams the nurse.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He gives no response.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I sense his coma is partially from medication.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I
know the shouting must hurt Jeff’s ears."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It hurts my ears and I’m eight feet away.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I want to grab the nurse and scream in her ear to stop it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I feel helpless.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Jeff!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It’s Mom.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Wake up,” Mary mimics the nurse but not nearly as loudly."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I look at Mary.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She would not be considered cover-girl material but she still looks beautiful to me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She wears jeans and a plaid blouse.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I realize I’m still attracted to her.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I see she is strong-willed like Mom and compassionate.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Hi, Mary,” I say gently."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She gazes a moment, gropes and finally wields to our presence."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She turns and looks over at Mom and says, “Hi, Doris,” and then to Dad,

32 Volume One W E W A N T T O L I V E ! -"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"T H E P R I M A L D I E T
“Josef.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Finally, she manages to look straight into my blue
eyes. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Hi, Dick.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Oh, that nickname."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"All the reasons I changed to a Greece-Roman-
sounding first name that I liked, flood my head."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"No matter how “Dick” was said to me, the innuendo was prevalent."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It was like wearing a bright name tag with “scum” printed on it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My brothers, classmates, and some teachers often used it to patronize me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“As you can see, Jeff isn’t with us,” Mary says bluntly."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I see the strain in her face and body.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I want to hug and comfort her but that is out of the question.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Instead, empathic tears fill my eyes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Seventeen years passed before I stopped dreaming about her.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary turns to Jeff. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Dick is here to see you.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Wake up, boy,” she says, trying to humor and ease her new tension because of my presence."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Oh, geezus , I’m going to break down."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Jeff.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Jeff, it’s Aajonus,” I say softly."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My voice
cracks."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He doesn’t move.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“May I see his charts, please,” I politely ask the nurse."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She is stunned and then derisive, “Are you a visiting doctor?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Mary chortles and jokes, “No."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He’s from Los Angeleees, California.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She gives it the sneering tone that she gave the nickname Dick.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The nurse chuckles, then settles, confused."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“This is Jeff’s other father,” Mary explains."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The nurse and I introduce ourselves.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“When is the soonest I can see Jeff’s X-rays?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I ask
kindly. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You’ll have to speak to one of his neurologists.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“How many does he have?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Four.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Lead me to one of them.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Dr. Braisley just left the floor and none of the others are expected
until morning.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Can we talk in the hall a minute, please?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She scrutinizes my patient but determined stare.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She realizes I could
be trouble."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She turns and we walk into the hall.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Debra, I’m not here to make your job difficult."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m here because my son is dying.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I want to do everything I can to help him live.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"OUT OF THE GRIPS OF DISEASE AND DEATH 33
“Are you a physician?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My inclination is to mimic her patronizing attitude but that wouldn’t be
constructive, “I’m a nutritional counselor."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And I’m Jeff’s biological father.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I have the right to see all of his records upon request.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Would you be kind enough to make that as easy and as soon as possible?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Please?” “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I can’t do that.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"One of his doctors has to, and I don’t know if Dr. Braisley is still on rounds,” she says in a friendlier tone. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You’ll have
to wait until morning."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Okay?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Would you give me his number, please?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I’ll have his answering
service page him and have him call me here.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I’ll call his service,” she relinquishes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“One more thing?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When he calls and you tell him my request, if he
refuses please tell him I would like to speak with him."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Will you do that for me and my son?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Please?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She relaxes, shrugs and snickers, “Okay, sir.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Thank you.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"And would you pass the word to all the doctors and nurses that Jeff’s biological father is here, that I will be taking an active part in his recovery?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She is slightly impressed and amused but her reaction says she thinks my ego is larger than my brain.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"There are times when I would agree, but ego has nothing to do with this."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“The doctors all agree that Jeff isn’t going to--” Compassion, I think, restrains her from finishing."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"5
Finally, Mary and I are alone with Jeff."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We ease into light conversation for a while.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I mention that I am a nutritional counselor.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I say a little

34 Volume One W E W A N T T O L I V E ! -"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"T H E P R I M A L D I E T
about my nutritional point of view."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask her if she would like to care for Jeff at home.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She gives me a look of astonishment and absurdity.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She tells me she wouldn’t even consider removing Jeff from the hospital.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She vacuums the mucus oozing into Jeff’s throat so he can breathe without choking.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“The mucus is good.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Through it, his body dumps dead cells and debris from the brain quickly."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"More will go to his bowels and dump there,” I say."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“How do you know all of that stuff?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Remember when I said I was disabled from a car accident and couldn’t pay child support?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had cancer.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I didn’t want anyone to know.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was disabled from the therapies.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"A kind, wonderful and intelligent man named Bruno tutored me for three and a half years in nutrition."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ve spent most of the last seventeen years researching and experimenting with diets and health.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She frowns and looks at me curiously.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I’ll tell you about it later.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Did all of the doctors tell you that Jeff’s going to die?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Mary nods, “They said if he hadn’t responded by Wednesday, he’d die any time soon.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I know you think I’m a California nut cake, but I’m asking you to put that judgment aside for Jeff’s sake."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Let me try nutrition.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I know you mean well, Aajonus.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She stops to take a deep breath, drained, then teases, “But he’s not exactly able to eat.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“We can feed him under his tongue,” I say handing her a canning jar."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,In it are equal portions of unsalted raw butter and unheated honey mixed together.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I explain its properties and I conclude by saying, “His salivary enzymes will dissolve it."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Some will be absorbed directly into his blood through his mouth.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The rest will drain down, soothe his throat and eventually, his stomach."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In the blood, the nutrients from the butter/honey mix will go to his brain to protect living tissue and carry away the bruised and dead for elimination."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I would like to put a teaspoon under his tongue at least every forty minutes.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A little hope sprouts and gives her strength. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Okay.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,If you think it’ll help.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I am astounded.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And relieved.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Happy tears fill my eyes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I hold back

though."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary might think I’m weak.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I must appear in complete control to defend Jeff.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I put some honey/butter mix under Jeff’s tongue.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask Mary if I may tell her about some of my nutritional work so she will know my perspective on nutrition versus medical methods.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“It beats just sitting here,” Mary says."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“One day I arrived home at 9:30 p.m. from one of those exciting evenings in traffic school.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Mary chuckles, “Still speeding?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“U-turn.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I couldn’t seem to comprehend that a residential-apartment- complex neighborhood was not a residential area.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Anyway, it was a Tuesday in January, 1973."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was twenty-six at the time.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I walked through the courtyard toward my Hollywood apartment.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,There were no lights on in the apartment.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wondered where Monica was.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I took my keys from my flared-bottom jeans.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I inserted one in the lock.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My neighbor, Lien, heard me and came bursting from her apartment."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She was panting, not from hurry but horror."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Aajonus!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I took Monica to County General Hospital about two hours ago.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She was having terrible stomach cramps.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She came crawling over to my door, screaming."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I, we, just panicked."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I took her to Emergency.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“She didn’t say anything about her stomach four hours ago.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,What is it?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“They said it would take a while to do all the tests.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But they thought it was appendicitis.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I felt panicked.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But I concealed it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Monica was still in Emergency when I arrived.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was relieved that she was not on an operating table.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She laid on a gurney looking drugged and in pain.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The doctor stood analyzing the lab reports.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Monica,” I teased, imitating Bell Lagosi portraying Count Dracula, “let me take care of you at home, my dear."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Your body probably won’t like the chemicals they’ll pump into--”
“They haven’t found out what it is for sure,” she said, cutting me off."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"36
Volume One W E W A N T T O L I V E ! -"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"T H E P R I M A L D I E T
The doctor stepped toward us and said, “If you’re not a relative, please leave."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Monica, you have peritonitis, which means that your intestines are infected, and possibly perforated and bleeding."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It’s serious.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Excuse me?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I said.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I feel badly about it now but I had little patience with doctors’ scare tactics after my experiences.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I mirrored his arrogant, patronizing attitude, and asked him, “Have you every had peritonitis?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“No,” he said as if my question were absurd."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I have.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Would that make me more knowledgeable?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I’ve treated forty cases of peritonitis and if she leaves she’ll
die,” he asserted."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“How many of those forty patients died?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I asked.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The doctor stammered but quickly recovered, “Twenty-
four.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I motioned for Monica to listen.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“So at worst Monica has a 60% chance of dying in here, is that
right?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The doctor nodded.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“That’s something they won’t normally tell you,” I said to Monica. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Without treatment she has no chance,” he countered. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"How many cases do you know in which someone had
peritonitis and treated it with wholistic methods?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“None,” he said firmly."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Then how would you know that she would die without medical
treatment?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I asked, putting him in checkmate."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Common sense,” he retorted."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Do only doctors have this common sense?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“These are ridiculous questions.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If you knew the seriousness of
this infection, you would be embarrassed.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Excuse me?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Which of the two of us had peritonitis?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I asked. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m not answering any more of your questions.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He turned to
Monica, “Are you going to listen to this character and put your life in danger?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Or do you have some sense?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Monica, he’s trying to play you like an untuned piano inside a yoyo.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Mary laughs, “Did you really say that?!”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,OUT OF THE GRIPS OF DISEASE AND DEATH 37 “Yes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Monica laughed but the doctor didn’t.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Then I said to Monica:
“According to R.B. Pearson’s research and statistics listed in his book Man’s Correct Diet, you have a 93% chance of living if you let me care for you nutritionally."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Come on, honey, let’s go home.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I turned back to the doctor and said, “I’m sorry."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I know you mean well but your logic is off.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Urgently, he raised his voice, “Don’t you get it?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,If the infection isn’t stopped she’ll die.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Monica’s drug-intoxicated state had the side effect of lowering her blood pressure and heightening paranoia.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She was terrified.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She looked back and forth between the doctor and me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Sweetheart, listen to his reasoning."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He’s going to treat you with antibiotics to kill the infection.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That will also kill your intestinal flora.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That will destroy your ability to digest food and synthesize your own proteins and B vitamins.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If you can’t properly digest the nutrients you need, you won’t detoxify and heal properly.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I’m warning you, if you don’t stay here and stop the infection you’ll die for certain,” the doctor countered."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wanted to suture his mouth.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And I’m sure he wanted to suture mine.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The fear on Monica’s face advertised that the doctor’s unsubstantiated scare tactics had won the debate.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was saddened.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was angry.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But I decided that I should argue no further.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had been introduced to an ideal concept called unconditional love a few years ago.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It meant respecting Monica’s decision even if her life were at risk.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It was her life and her will be done.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Twenty-four hours later, I stood looking down at her."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,On her arms and thighs were badly bruised dome-shaped swellings the size of quartered tennis balls.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Monica, please take a look at the blackness around your sunken eyes, and your sallow complexion."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They treat you not knowing how you’ll react to chemicals,” I cried out."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Drugged, she looked in a hand mirror and laughed, “Don’t be silly."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It’s okay.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I’m okay, really."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I love you too.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I couldn’t bear looking at her in that state and keep my mouth shut.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I drove home.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The next morning she had two more bruised swellings on her

arms."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Dr. Pine, the young intern assigned to her, looked over her chart. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Doctor,” I said gently, “Monica needs live nutrients including various strains of lactobacillus to aid her digestion."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I’m going to
take her home where I can feed her properly.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He shook his head and gave me a look that said, Oh, you’re one
of those misguided health fanatics."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Then he said aloud, “Eating will exacerbate the infection."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I’ll give her a prescription for all the vitamins and minerals to be added to her I.V. Don’t worry, we’re taking good care of Monica.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Why does she have these lumps and bruises all over her body?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I pleaded, and then added, “They aren’t healing."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They’re getting worse by the hour.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“She was allergic to penicillin and three other antibiotics,” he said."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“It took you seven shots to discover one she was not allergic to?” “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Yes.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“You just said not to worry, you are taking good care of her?” “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Now everything is under control.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“She has a hundred times more ailments to heal than when she came in here.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Why are you saying you have everything under control?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Everything is okay now.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I’ll put the vitamins in her I.V. and she’ll be fine,” he said testily."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“She’s betting her life on your expertise.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Will you bet your expertise on her life?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“We’ll do the best we can for her.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"We can’t promise anything,” he said."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Doctor, please, you just said you had everything under control now."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Why won’t you put your expertise on her life?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ll put my wholistic logic on her life.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ll even put my life on her life.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Why won’t you?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“We’re not miracle workers.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Will you excuse me, I have many patients in this hospital who need my help,” he said unnerved and briskly walked out."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I tried to convince Monica to leave but she was too intoxicated and drowsy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In the evening of Monica’s fifth day in the hospital, I stood over

OUT OF THE GRIPS OF DISEASE AND DEATH 39
her."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Her entire body was sallow with areas of black and blue.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She had a milky stare that I had seen in animals just before they died.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I realized I had to act.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Monica,” I pleaded, “you have to get hold of yourself."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You have to become sober so you can examine yourself.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She was so drugged she didn’t care.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“You have to refuse your sedatives and painkillers so you can make a clear decision about whether you are being helped or damaged.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The nurse is due to give you your 8 o’clock shot.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Refuse it, please."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Just until the doctors get here in the morning.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Please, baby, please.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She smiled.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I placed in her hand a jar full of liquefied raw
foods. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"This will aid and soothe your intestines,” I said."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“What is it?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,she whispered.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I blended one raw fertile egg, one tomato, 2 tablespoons
unsalted raw butter and two heaping tablespoons of unheated honey."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It also regulates fever.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"”6
“It doesn’t sound very tasty,” she
whispered. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Will you give it a chance?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She sipped it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Then, I guess because it was the first food she had
in days, she gulped it."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My immediate thought was to stop her.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But her gulping was instinctual.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I put the empty jar back in a bag.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When I looked again, she was asleep."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I stared at her frightful appearance.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I remembered how beautiful her blushing color and pretty skin had been.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,An hour passed and the raw tomato/butter formula had sobered her enough.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She argued with the nurses against taking any more medication that night.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And she won.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The next morning, I said to Monica, “Sweetheart, look at yourself.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I pulled the covers down to her ankles and lifted her gown.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She looked at herself in horror, “Oh, my God, I’m going to die.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Not if you let me take care of you.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wondered how I knew that.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I’m scared, Aajonus.”"

“I’m afraid, too."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Yet, I’m certain that excellent health and raw (live) foods are as connected as falling and gravity."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The doctor said if you ate anything it would make you worse.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Your abdomen didn’t swell and bruise from the raw food mixture.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It has given you strength.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"God, I love you Monica."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Don’t die on me, please."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Please let me help you?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I explained the three different food formulas I devised to get her well.7
“Did you marry her?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary asks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“No.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We were together five years.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Haven’t you found anyone you wanted to marry?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“It took me seventeen years to stop dreaming about you.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"How could I
have stayed married while dreaming of you?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It’s an awkward moment for both of us.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I continue the story.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Monica agreed to go home.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I gave her another jar of the tomato and butter mixture to drink.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I went to the nurses and asked them to remove Monica’s I.V. and catheter.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They refused.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"While I analyze how to remove Monica’s catheter, three security guards, two nurses and three large male orderlies hurried into the room, stopped abruptly and stood watching me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,If I had caught it on film it would have looked like one of those old black-and-white Buster Keaton films with that sudden stop-and-go motion.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I covered Monica.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Immediately following came three doctors with the same comical go-and-stop motion.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"One of them was the intern, Dr. Pine."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"With the humor inspired by the moment I turned to Monica, “They’re having a going away party for you."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Isn’t that sweet?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“She can’t leave here.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I won’t release her,” said Dr. Pine."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The gall these guys have is amazing, I thought."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I laughed, a short breathy laugh that was enough to insult him."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That was not my intention but it happened.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I turned to Monica again, “Do you want his permission to go?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I knew I was irritating the doctor.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had mixed feelings about it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I

was still angry at doctors, in general."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“She can’t leave this hospital unless I release her.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And I won’t.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He turned to a nurse, “Call her mother right away.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Dr. Pine.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You’ve been really kind, and thank you."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m leaving here now.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"So, if you don’t remove this tube for me, Aajonus will,” Monica said so diplomatically and maturely she seemed like a
wise old empress."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Her manner affected everyone.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They all turned to Dr. Pine.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He
seemed alarmed that his authority was being challenged."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I won’t release you.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I won’t be responsible for whatever
happens if you leave this hospital,” he said."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I accept what you say.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Now will you, or a nurse help me
remove this, please?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Monica firmly implored.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Again everyone looked at Dr. Pine.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He stood there
staunchly. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Help me, Aajonus,” she ordered."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I pulled down Monica’s covers.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I looked around at everyone,
“This is not a show.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I started to lift Monica’s gown but Dr. Pine stopped me, “Wait."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A nurse will remove it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Let’s talk about this.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This is a life and death infection.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Do you think some voodoo will save her?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Whoa,” I said. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You thought throwing vitamins and minerals into her I.V. would help.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It didn’t.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We will cure her with foods.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That’s all I have to say.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If at some time in the future you are interested in what I feed Monica, I’ll gladly tell you."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Thank you.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Just then a nurse returned and blurted out, “Her mother says she
is not to leave this hospital.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Her mother’s voice rang through my head.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I dreaded her
intervention."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Do I look underage, Dr. Pine?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Monica said growing angry.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Her mother’s order had the opposite effect of what I had feared. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Monica,” Dr. Pine paused, “Please, take a few prescriptions I’ll
write for you.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Monica and I simultaneously raised our surprised eyebrows at
each other; the fascist air had thinned."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Give me whatever you want me to take,” she said."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“You must take an antibiotic to kill the infection or you won’t
have a chance."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ll give you a painkiller to take as you need.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Call

me here everyday between nine and two and I’ll do whatever I can to help.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The tension was still so high that the phone ringing startled all of us.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Monica looked at me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We knew who it was.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Hi, Mom."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m just about to leave the hospital.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Call me at home in about an hour, okay?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I’m walking out the door, call me at home,” Monica said."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She looked at me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She curled and twisted her smiling mouth, warning me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She tried to hand me the phone.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Exaggeratedly, I shook my head and waved no."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Monica laughed the way she did when I had been unintentionally acting silly.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“It’ll be easier on all of us later if you can make some sense to her now,” Monica said still laughing."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was amazed at how much energy she had gained from the last tomato and butter drink.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Reluctantly, I took the phone, “Hi, Ruth.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Monica’s divorced mother insisted I call her Ruth.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It seemed to remove the generation gap.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I liked that and we liked each other.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“It’s you forcing Monica to leave the hospital, isn’t
it?” “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I’ve only fastened a chain from my car to her
ankle.” “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This is not funny.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Ruth.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You’ve seen Monica’s condition since she’s been in here.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m certain she’ll do better at home.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“The nurse said she’d die if she leaves the hospital.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Ruth’s
blood pressure was rising."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“What would they say if she died in the hospital? ‘
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The treatment
was a success, we stopped the infection."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"We’re sorry Monica’s dead, and here’s the bill.’ ”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Dr. Pine gave me a look.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Ruth argued parroting the doctor’s every word although her concern was genuine.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I understand that perspective but it doesn’t make it right just because a doctor says it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You think lawyers are a big rip-off, right?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Well, doctors are well-educated like attorneys,” I countered knowing it was a cheap shot."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Dr. Pine and the nurse glared at me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“If my daughter dies,” Ruth paused. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ll kill you.”

“It’s just something you say in a fit of passion,” Mary
says. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It sent a chill through me because she meant it.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The nurse’s voice announces through the intercom above Jeff’s bed,
“The doctor is on the phone about Jeff’s X-rays.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I am delighted.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I get up, feel Jeff’s forehead and put some
honey/butter mix under his tongue."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I tell Mary a quick conclusion to the story. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Monica left the hospital in a wheelchair and was bedridden.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I convinced her to flush the antibiotics down the toilet.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Her mother threatened to skewer me on a clothesline.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I fed Monica the mixtures.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Within five days, Monica was on her feet and blending the food mixtures herself."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,In six weeks she was back in ballet classes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That was seventy-two weeks sooner than the doctors said she would if she survived in the hospital.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was so astounded by her rapid recovery that I vowed to eat only raw foods.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary seems impressed and hopeful.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The fear that I might let her down suddenly hits me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Even so, I must advance into battle or lose Jeff. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff needs to be off medication.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He needs to be conscious to eat and recover,” I say."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary looks pensive and doesn’t answer.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I leave her to think about it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"6
I ponder as I sit waiting in Radiology about accumulated radiation
emissions from X-rays being absorbed by everything."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The lights, walls, floor, furniture and abstract paintings on the walls seem to glow."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I feel a hyper-irritating sensation, as if my nerves and bones want to wear an ultraviolet shield."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wonder if Dr. Braisley told the radiologists to make me wait here for the last two hours.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Could he be punishing me for questioning his analysis and diagnosis?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff is upstairs needing the honey/butter mix.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It’s 11 p.m. and few patients have passed through this department and there’s no backlog.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Why is it taking so long?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,44 Volume One W E W A N T T O L I V E ! -
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"T H E P R I M A L D I E T
I also wonder if the older radiologists are balding from exposure to these “low” levels of radiation."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Is it absorbed into their skulls, gradually making the follicles impotent at producing hair?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Mr. Marshall?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"the white-uniformed, partially balding radiologist says as he approaches me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I consider accepting Jeff’s adopted name, Marshall, for the moment."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I could avoid explaining my relation to Jeff.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"But I don’t want Ben being mistaken for me, considering my radical presence in the hospital."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I explain as the radiologist takes me into a room.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Aisles of open shelves full of X-ray files line most of the floor space.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,On one wall is mounted a row of backlit white opaque glass with X- rays hanging against them.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They are of Jeff’s head taken by CAT scan.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I see three oval areas that portend severe brain damage.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I see images of Jeff crashing through glass.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I cringe and take a deep breath.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The radiologist points to the spots, “These are filling with fluids and creating pressure on Jeff’s brain."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The doctors are going to tap and drain them to prevent further brain damage.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I listen to the prognosis without comment.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I visualize them assaulting Jeff’s body as they drill into his skull.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I know if I tell the radiologist that fresh raw green vegetable juices and no-salt-added raw cheese could help draw out the fluids without drilling into Jeff’s head, he’d have me in a circus by day’s end."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I have to get Jeff out of the coma so he can eat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I realize the next step is to eliminate consciousness-interfering drugs.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Wait, stop."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wonder if Jeff wants to live.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I won’t force his soul to stay in his body if it wants to leave.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Somehow, I must get his permission."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I thank the radiologist and go back to Jeff.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary and a nurse wrestle Jeff’s arms and convulsing body down.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff’s subconscious has burst through and pulls out the urinary catheter.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The bulb at the end is inflated.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It tears his urethra.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Blood spurts and spatters from his penis everywhere on him and the sheets.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Can’t you see his body doesn’t want the thing in him?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I say.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“He’ll be wetting the bed constantly and he’s too big and heavy for us to be changing him all the time,” the nurse says annoyed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I know I am not going to be around every forty-five minutes to

OUT OF THE GRIPS OF DISEASE AND DEATH 45
change a diaper and bed, so I don’t say any more."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Mary tells me, as if confessing, that Jeff had pulled the catheter twice before."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I shudder.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I remember that after stomach surgery I had sharp, burning pain in my penis when I urinated."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I felt as if I were being painfully electrocuted during orgasm, with the electrodes connected to my urethra."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It still happens occasionally.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Now I wonder if I had unconsciously pulled my catheter.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Had I ripped the tissues and damaged the nerves?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Is that what made my urethra so sensitive?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The nurse and Mary finish changing the sheets and Jeff’s gown.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"One nurse reinserts the catheter, the other leaves."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary tells me she’s taking a snack break and goes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The last nurse
leaves."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I lean close to Jeff’s head.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I give him entrancing suggestions.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I repeat
them until I see that he is probably hypnotized."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I tell him I want to speak to his psyche (spirit).
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask him if he wants to live.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I suggest the slightest positive or negative response.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"A vague movement up or down for “yes”, to either side for “no”, from his head or hands, or his eyes behind his closed eyelids."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He gives no response.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I assume that he has chosen death.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A lump forms in my throat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I recall my near death experience of seventeen years ago when I was 22.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was experimenting with mind expansion to find specific answers about my health and reality.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It was early Spring.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had already put my cancer in remission with diet but I still had multiple health troubles.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My youngest uncle, Lanny, who had been studying for his doctorate in psychology and worked as a Teaching Assistant at the University of California, Los Angeles was guiding me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We had consumed psilocybin (a manufactured chemical form of an hallucinogen) and smoked a mixture of hashish and marijuana.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"At first, Lan and I had a wonderful experience communicating telepathically."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then the pleasant effects of the drugs had worn off and my mind was normal again.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then I realized I was having an extremely adverse reaction.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My blood pressure was dangerously low.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It was 86° inside my apartment but I was freezing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My lower back ached so badly I couldn’t sit or stand comfortably.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That was normal but this pain was approaching unbearable.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I remember lying on the floor next to the floor heater.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,46 Volume One W E W A N T T O L I V E ! -
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"T H E P R I M A L D I E T
“I’m still freezing.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“It’s all in your mind.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Imagine a fire,” Lanny said."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I imagined sitting next to a fire.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Then I imagined the fire inside my
body."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This provided a bit of relief but did not raise my blood pressure. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m still freezing and my back aches.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“It’s all in your mind,” Lanny said."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I rose from the couch and turned the heater to the highest
temperature."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I stood on top of the heater in my tennis shoes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Lanny began to complain that he was suffering heat prostration.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Isn’t it all in your mind?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I asked.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He rose from the couch and left.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I noticed the hands on the clock pointed to 12:47 p.m. As I stood on
the heater I was slightly more comfortable."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I became aware that my skin was turning ashen.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was weakening.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I fell back slouching against the wall.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I thought I was losing consciousness but instead I turned inside out with a pop.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I detached from my body.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I felt free and whole.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I knew this experience was not an hallucination and I became frightened.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then I realized there was nothing to fear and my fear disappeared.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I left my body.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I hovered above it, circling."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My body was still propped against the wall, dead."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Of all things, I was leaving my body with fresh pizza stains on my shirt."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,What would Mom think if she knew I died with pizza stains on my shirt?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Suddenly, I drifted upward through the ceiling."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Through the upstairs apartment.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The roof.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And into the sky.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I flew into the stratosphere and glided through it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Everything went dark as if it were a moonless night, except the stars, which were clear, and the Earth, which glowed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I traveled backward toward the Sun, faster until the Earth became pea-sized."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Suddenly I realized that I had an invisible form.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I felt an intense brightness penetrating me from behind.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It was the Sun.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I turned inside out to look toward the Sun.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After I turned inside out this time, I saw in all directions at once."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I sped into the Sun.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It seemed like a bright white tunnel.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Inside the Sun I turned inside out again.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Pop.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I seemed liquid now.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I swelled like an invisible balloon.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had become the Sun.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wondered how that was possible.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The answer came instantly; it was simply the nature of that reality.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then my stratosphere - my skin - dissolved.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Like water I seeped through all of creation.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I experienced an

OUT OF THE GRIPS OF DISEASE AND DEATH 47
infinite sense of oneness and I was all that is."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I enjoyed eternity briefly.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The ultimate oxymoron, I thought."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I
laughed and every particle in creation laughed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Although so obvious, I realized that laughter is an expression of joy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Joy is the appreciation of Creation, of beingness."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I realized that without joy a sense of separateness ensues.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And then fear.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Beingness loses its sense of love that unites everything.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Joy is more important than I had ever imagined.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then I formed into a tornado-like mass.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I focused my consciousness in the calm center.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I watched lives swirl around me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In that whirlpool of lives, I saw that I had been a Sun, many lives on many planets, and other existences that I can not describe."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I relived each of those lives from birth to death with tremendous speed, yet I seemed to understand more."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Emotions were the gage of experience here, that is, what I and everybody felt and thought as a result of my actions was all important."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The importance of these lives was creating joy/love.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Unconditional love.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Finally I glimpsed a lonely, unhappy, unloved and sometimes unloving life in this whirlpool."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It was full of resentment.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It was my “Dick” life.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I relived that life.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I felt sick, weak and angry."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I realized that for my life to be happy I had to love myself completely.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had to heal my instincts and intuition.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Through instinct my body communicates with me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Through intuition my psyche (soul or spirit) communicates with me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I knew that every decision should be a trilateral agreement between my psyche (intuition), body (instinct) and mind (reason)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,In that order.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I saw that health and happiness in my Earth-reality started at the most basic level, my body."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I saw that my body cells were loving, feeling and intelligent."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I should have loved them more.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Listened to them.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Helped them enjoy life.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My cells wanted to experience so much more with me but they were strained, exhausted and deformed from environmental and dietary adulterations."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I realized that I had wanted to love my cells all along.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Their love was evident, trying to help me enjoy life."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I wanted them to enjoy being part of me, with as much effort I wanted to love my cells as much as they loved me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But conditioning and education confused my instincts and intuition.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had been forced to mistrust myself.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Now, I thought, if I had it to do over again, I would take better care of my cells, to heal my cells."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I saw that the cells in food were alive,

48 Volume One W E W A N T T O L I V E ! -"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"T H E P R I M A L D I E T
loving, feeling and intelligent also."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I saw that cooking food kills most of its vitality that we would receive if we were to eat food fresh and raw.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I saw how much disease, pain and unhappiness comes from eating dead toxic food."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I realized that my body cells could have gradually transmuted to magnificent health in several decades of care if I would have eaten raw foods.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Also, I realized that I had chosen the diseased state, my diseased life, to learn about and create health."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I felt excitement growing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I felt overwhelmed with compassion.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wanted to return to Earth.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I would literally reverse the direction of my life from the inside out.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Instantly a change came over me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I became a black hole and I traveled at many times the speed of light.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I realized that my desire was sending me back to Earth.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I felt whole again - loved and loving; recharged with vital loving purpose.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I traveled through the psychic umbilical cord – a black hole - to my pitiful dead physical body on the heater.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I exploded into my body, turning outside in."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My body bolted upright.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The power of my love started my heart beating again and warmed it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My blood began to move again sluggishly.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was still ashen.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I smelled burning rubber.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"With tremendous effort, I opened my heavy eyelids."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was looking down at my tennis-shoed feet on the heater’s grill.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I noticed the maroon telephone cord had melted black and was about to catch fire.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I couldn’t control any part of my body, except my eyes.. I felt a bit panicked."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My adrenaline rushed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The hands of the clock pointed to 4:17 p.m. My body had been dead three and a half hours.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Slowly my body began responding to my thoughts.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I flipped the telephone cord off but it fragmented, melted onto the grill."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I tried to step off the grill but my tennis shoes were melted to it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was exhausted and sick.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I forced myself to pull hard.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Finally, my shoes released."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I went into the kitchen and grabbed a barbecue fork.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I returned to the heater.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I removed the grill with the fork.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I trudged with it to the back driveway and put it down.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I felt the warmth of the Sun on my body and I relaxed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I felt more alive every second, many of my cells were returning to life."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The thought of delicious, heavily buttered garlic bread came to mind."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I knew it was instinct, my body telling me what it needed to raise my blood pressure."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I went back into my apartment and ate a little crushed

OUT OF THE GRIPS OF DISEASE AND DEATH 49
raw garlic with fresh raw unripe pineapple, lots of raw unsalted butter and a little French bread."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I hadn’t eaten bread in 13 years.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Except of a little digestive difficulty from the cooked bread, within moments I felt better, satisfied."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I decided from then on that at least 70% of my diet would consist of raw foods.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I remember that that was 21⁄2 years before my experience with Monica in the hospital.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I went to bed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I fell asleep knowing instinctively and intuitively that sleep is where I would do most of my healing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I become aware that I am in the hospital at Jeff’s side.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I touch his cheek.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Do you want to live, Jeff?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask again.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I watch him intently for an eternal minute, anticipating, hoping for any indication from him."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Good-bye, son."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wish you happiness wherever you’ve gone.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Suddenly, Jeff’s voice surges loudly and clearly past the tubes, “Live!”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"7
Willy, Mary’s father, enters looking burdened and disgruntled; the
opposite of my memories of him."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I haven’t seen or talked with him since we erected the swing set for Jeff’s second birthday 20 years ago.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He ignores me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Any change?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,he whispers to Mary.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary shakes her head no.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She says, “Good night, Dad,” ignores me and leaves."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Willy and I sit uneasily.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After five minutes, I break the silence, “Hi,
Willy.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He nods without looking at me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Remember how you, Margaret, Shirley,” - his older daughter -
“Mary and I used to play pinochle for hours?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Before that I’d never experienced adults enjoying children for more than several minutes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Thank you.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"That helped turn me from cynic to skeptic,” I say jokingly

but meaning it."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Well, you broke the bubble, Dick."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You and Shirley’s ex-husband,
Bill."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You two screwed up my daughters and then dumped them.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Neither of you deserved them, that’s for sure.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“For everyone’s sake, it was better that I left."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was so difficult.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I was confused, frustrated and enraged.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“You have to learn how to discipline yourself,” he says disgustedly. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Not
when it was at Mary and Jeff’s expense."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My body had developed biological habits from so much fear, anger and violence caused by my jealous brother Doug, and my father’s brutal punishments."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Either my blood sugar would drop, causing depression, or my adrenaline would soar and I couldn’t control my excess energy, causing manic behavior, or blood sugar would drop while adrenaline soared, causing irritability and sour disposition."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,When I first went to California my Uncle Lanny gave me some cognitive self-help tools.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I learned to control myself.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I mainly handle it through diet, now."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I never met Lanny.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I think you did.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Of my mother’s twelve siblings he is the youngest - only eleven years older than I. Lanny was the witty one.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He was more like the understanding brother that I had wanted.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Do you have any idea, the hardships you caused everyone?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I can imagine.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He sits back, defeated, “Imagine?"

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I was so afraid of being hurt and taken advantage of, I desperately and sometimes maliciously tried to get control of things."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I had been taught that a man had to be mean and callous, deceitful and ruthless to be in control of body, relationships, spirituality and economy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I even thought ‘Leave It To Beaver’ was all Hollywood hoopla because I rarely experienced people who were understanding.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Compassion wasn’t normal.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Goodness was an ideal that eluded me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was always prepared for life to knock the wind from me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I couldn’t learn to trust myself in an untrusting world.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,I didn’t realize that with that attitude I often forced people and experience to crash in on me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I rarely find myself a victim of my past anymore.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ve worked hard to change.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m not perfect by any means but I’m here to help.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That’s something I couldn’t do very well back then.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Whatever you can do.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Do you still repair machines or have you retired?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Retired a few years ago.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Do you and Margaret still live in that nice little house?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“We been separated a long time.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Along with my cynicism, I
developed a taste for alcohol."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I threatened her with a gun once.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was drunk.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Was it loaded?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Course not.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I just wanted to scare the bejeezus out of
her.” “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m sorry.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He nods but his look is too bitter to be forgiving.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I had been holding on to my memories of his family as proof that
family life could be happy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Now I know I was very responsible for his family breaking up.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I feel miserable.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But I wasn’t aware of any self- help tools at the time.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Self-forgiveness is my only appropriate action now.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I place honey/butter mix under Jeff’s tongue.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Willy and I sit quietly, uncomfortably."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“You making a living with your health stuff?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,he breaks the silence. “

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As long as I’m healthy, doing more than one thing, and

Sunday, September 28th
I awaken from napping in a chair and notice it’s almost 8 a.m. My first morning in the hospital."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Willy leaves the room.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I place honey/butter under Jeff’s tongue.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He seems more settled in that calmer state.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Looking somewhat rested, Mary walks in followed by Ben."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Willy returns and says good-bye.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Everyone seems laconic.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They are probably exhausted from six stressful days.8
I go to the anteroom for some raw pistachio nuts."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"A nurse enters, unlocks the medicine cabinet and removes a small bottle."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I eat as I follow her over to Jeff and she hands Mary the bottle.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“What’s that?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Medication,” says the nurse."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Yes, but what is it?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Dilantin,” she says, “Keeps him from having seizures.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“But it keeps him completely drunk and unconscious.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Would you rather he have seizures and die?!”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Mary pours a half teaspoonful of the thick medication into a spoon
and into Jeff’s mouth."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It looks like the raw custard I make when I use reddish Mexican papayas - like the ones I bought on my way here.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff’s mouth fills with saliva and drains into his throat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He chokes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The nurse takes a thin flexible plastic tube and vacuums his throat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“May I,” I ask the nurse."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She hands me the vacuum tube.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I lean close to Jeff’s face, blocking everyone’s view of his mouth."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I vacuum his throat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then I suction the diluted pool of Dilantin around his tongue.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I press the tube to his tongue and gums.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Another pool of saliva forms.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,No one will notice the medication is gone.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I notice the nurse returning the bottle to the medicine cabinet.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A sense of relief passes over me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,An attendant comes in with a food tray for Jeff.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I give Mary a curious look.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“We eat it,” Mary says."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,One of Jeff’s neurologists arrives on morning rounds.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We introduce ourselves.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I suddenly realize my blood sugar is very low.

the instant it leaves his mouth."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I go back to the anteroom and get some nonsteamed dates and raw butter to elevate my blood sugar.9 I return and eat while I watch the doctor examine Jeff’s stomach where there is a very long stitched incision.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“What’s that?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Dr. Japtur performed exploratory surgery, searching for internal bleeding."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"But there was none,” the doctor says."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I look over Jeff’s abdominal area, hips and lower back."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I see no bruises that would have indicated there could possibly have been internal bleeding.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I open Jeff’s eyes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Using Iridology as a diagnostic tool, I search for blood spots in his irises.10 Fading blood spots would indicate that there had recently been internal bleeding."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,There is none.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My adrenaline rushes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Sadness fills me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The invasive surgery is another problem for Jeff to heal.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I am angry that his life has been more endangered.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I wonder if Dr. Japtur, believing Jeff was going to die anyway, performed the unnecessary surgery to make a house or swimming pool payment, or pay for a daughter’s braces."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I remember the first remarkable experience I had after studying Iridology for two years.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My New Zealander girlfriend, Susan, and I were making love."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Her blond head was arched back and her hazel eyes were open.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I suddenly noticed a blood red spot in her right iris.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The spot was near the area relating to the peritoneum.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Sweetheart, are you spotting?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I asked.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She laughed, “You don’t have to worry, I’m not going to get pregnant."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I have an IUD.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“That’s not my concern.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Do you have pain in your stomach or uterus?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Are you spotting?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Well, yes, and yes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The pain only happens when I move in particular ways.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When we’re making love it hurts once in a while, just a little."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,How did you know?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Iridology.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“You see something that alarms you?!”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"9 See Appendix H, page 138."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,10 Iridology is a science using the patterns and discoloration in the irises to diagnose the body's condition without expensive dangerous X-rays or exploratory surgery.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,You might have a little problem that could become a big problem.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“But you don’t believe in doctors.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Disease is a natural process whereby the body cleanses itself of accumulated toxins that it hasn't been able to eliminate.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Most often the body just needs good nutrition and time.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But I think your IUD is causing problems.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It’s a foreign object that requires a mechanic to remove it.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Susan laid tensely on the examination table with her legs spread and feet in stirrups.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The doctor (in his early thirties, as I was) pulled his scissors clamp from her crotch."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,In its clasp was Susan’s IUD string.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It had become disconnected from the IUD.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Her tissue acids had dissolved the end like cat gut.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Susan’s IUD punctured through her uterus and floats somewhere in her abdomen,” the doctor said. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We have to perform emergency surgery.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It could cause peritonitis, which can be fatal."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You may lose your uterus.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Susan looked as if the wind had been knocked out of her.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Doctor, can we take this one step at a time?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I asked. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Since infections are the body’s response to foreign or toxic substances, when you remove the IUD you will eliminate the primary cause for severe infection (if Susan has one)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then her uterus will heal.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“If I get inside and find an infection that I consider dangerous, I will have to remove her uterus.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Couldn’t you give her body a week to see if it heals first?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I
asked. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If it looks bad, I’ll remove it.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I don’t like taking this attitude, but you leave me no choice."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If you
remove her uterus without giving her body a chance to cease the infection, we will file suit against you and this hospital."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Please, be clear that this will be personal against you because your treatment of Susan is personal."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When she signs the release for surgery, there will be a clause stating that you are not to do anything other than remove the IUD and possibly stitch the tear in her uterus, if necessary.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“We refuse to operate at all, then.”"

We_Want_To_Live.txt,I need the freedom to do what I think is right.”

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If you or any other qualified surgeon here refuses to perform the agreed upon necessary surgery, anything, anything from peritonitis to pneumonia to death that happens to Susan from this moment on, I will see that you and this hospital are swamped with litigation."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,All I’m asking is for you to give her a chance to heal with the IUD removed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You can always remove her uterus tomorrow or the next day if her condition gets serious, correct?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He looked deep into my eyes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He must have seen inside me and knew I meant it because his attitude changed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Yes, sir,” he said respectfully. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Administration will give you a release.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ll accept it with your limitation clause.”

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Maybe I should have been more patient.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“No.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You haven’t been unreasonable,” he said."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I sat in the lounge while Susan had surgery.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The doctor approached me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He smiled and said, “Susan is fine."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We easily found the IUD and the infection looks as if it will go quickly.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She has an inch long incision at the base of her belly button that is hardly noticeable.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My eyes filled, “Thank you, doctor.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Standing over Jeff, I realize that I have to let go of my anxiety about his unnecessary abdominal surgery."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"But I wonder, Why is it that doctors don’t use Iridology as a safe diagnostic tool?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Is it because it would not generate great profits?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I can’t think about that now, I must concentrate on what will benefit Jeff."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Doctor,” I say, “my son is much more likely to recover from his coma if we take him off medication.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He looks terrified and says, “That is not possible."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He will have seizures and infections without medication.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then everything we do for him will be for nothing.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I am feeding him enough unsalted raw butter to prevent seizures,” I say."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“You are feeding him what?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,he asks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Raw fat prevents seizures.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I put it under his tongue every twenty to forty minutes.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Remember Monica?

We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Please, Aajonus, don’t make things more difficult for everybody,” Mary says firmly."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I remember the Dilantin looking exactly like the raw custard.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I will sabotage the medication.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I go into the anteroom, unpack my blender and food."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I make a thinner-than-usual raw custard.11 I sit and eat some, waiting for everyone to leave."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Finally, I am alone with Jeff."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I want to increase Jeff’s thirst for juices, so I turn down the drip-speed of his I.V. I remind myself that the honey I am giving him eliminates his need for sugar water."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I wish I could remove the I.V.
I lift a fork from the food tray and bend back one prong."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I return to the anteroom and stick the bent prong in the medicine cabinet’s lock.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The lock is loose and seems broken.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I jiggle it until it turns and opens.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wonder if this act is a crime.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Could I go to jail for trying to save my son?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Trembling, I empty the contents of two bottles of Dilantin into the sink."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It has such a strong odor, anybody who walks in might be suspicious."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I rinse it down with cold water.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I take a Dilantin bottle and pour in the custard.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The bottle neck is small and the custard so thick it spills all over.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I am so nervous I can barely manage tapping the bottle on my palm to get the custard to enter and settle.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"One finished, I lift the other bottle and fill it with custard."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wipe both bottles and cap them.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I hear someone in the hallway.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I return the bottles to the cabinet and close it just as the nurse enters.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She doesn’t stop or say anything.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wipe the sink so she won’t notice me trembling.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I hope she doesn’t notice the cabinet isn’t locked.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She walks to Jeff and injects a syringe into the catheter on his I.V. She notices the I.V. speed is slow.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,I join her. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,What’s that?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“It’s too strong to put more than a little in his blood at a time.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I’ll be
back every ten minutes until the syringe is empty,” she says, walking out."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I turn down the I.V. speed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wonder why she didn’t answer my question.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The drug is probably to keep Jeff’s blood pressure low.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Low blood pressure in his condition interferes with healing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"And if Jeff is anything like me, he could die from low blood pressure."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I remove the syringe and empty its contents into the sink.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I refill the syringe with a solution of Evian water and a drop of honey.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I tremble again.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I have barely completed the task when the nurse returns.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I watch her squeeze the syringe.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A little water/honey mix enters the I.V. and Jeff’s veins.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A wave of relief passes over me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She notices the drip is slow again.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Looking puzzled, she turns it up and leaves again."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I turn the I.V. speed down.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I return to the anteroom and insert the bent prong into the cabinet and lock it.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,In life and death situations in the past I have been afraid that something I did would go wrong.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This is the riskiest and most dangerous circumstance I have been in.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Sorry about Jeff.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I give him a hug.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It is awkward for both of us.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It is the first sincere hug of our lives.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Optimists see benefit in every calamity; cynics see calamity in every benefit.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,He may never be able to take a bath when he wants.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He may never be able to do anything by himself.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Would he rather die?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I remember wanting to die.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It was midsummer on Jekyll Island, Georgia."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My girlfriend, Owanza, and I were walking to the beach a block away."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I spotted a patch of beautiful white mushrooms in a neighbor’s yard. (
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had identified and eaten mushrooms in the island’s woods from the time I had arrived six months earlier.)
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Because these mushrooms resembled a poisonous amanita, I cleared the ground at the base of one of them."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I searched it for a cup-like lip that the similar- looking amanita forms.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I didn’t find one, so Owanza and I shared a tasty mushroom the size of my fist."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ate two thirds and she ate a third.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"We talked and strolled the north beach where few people were that early hour, along the sudsy ebb and flow where sandpipers dashed in and out spearing the sand with their long thin beaks."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The shrimp boats just beyond the sandbars tooted.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Two hours later and three miles up the beach, Owanza vomited again and again."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She had had terminal cancer.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Becoming weak and vomiting was common for her back then.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"All of the mushroom and part of her breakfast seeped into the sand or washed

into the ocean."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"We walked a short distance to the road hoping to see someone we
knew to give us a ride home."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Then I began feeling shaky, dizzy and exhausted."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I realized we had eaten a poisonous mushroom.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wondered why I hadn’t felt nauseous.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Why hadn’t my body reject it as Owanza’s body had?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Of course, the vagus nerve to my stomach had been severed in the surgery for my stomach cancer."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My body’s ability to defend itself from such a mistake had been damaged.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I felt an ominous sensation, like I was about to enter the twilight zone."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I waved my arms to stop a car and the couple took us home.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,At home I began to vomit.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Nothing spilled but saliva and hot acidic gases that burned my throat, sinuses and nostrils."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Within another half hour, muscles in my feet and legs began to cramp."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I fell to the bathroom floor.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The cramps traveled to my head.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Every muscle, including my facial muscles, was in a lumpy knot."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Pain was excruciating.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I twisted into a fetal position.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Owanza tried to help but when she touched me the cramps worsened.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I couldn’t speak.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I moaned and tears streamed from my eyes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Owanza began to weep.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My muscles, locked in knots and started to spasm."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The next twenty minutes seemed an eternity.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I fell unconscious from pain and exhaustion.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I awakened about twenty minutes later, tired and very thirsty."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I got off the floor.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Immediately, my feet and legs cramped."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I fell to the floor.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I asked Owanza to get me some water, fast."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I guzzled a quart just before the cramps reached my hands.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Again, I laid in a painfully twisted fetal position for fifteen minutes and passed out."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I awakened twenty minutes later thirsty and having to urinate.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Cautiously, I moved my hands and arms to see if movement would initiate cramps."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My limbs felt foreign, detached, but I had no cramps."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I carefully flexed my toes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The cycle of cramps started again.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I’ll call your mother,” Owanza said trembling."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“No!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She’ll put me in a hospital and I’ll be dead within days.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,People die from mushroom poisoning because they dehydrate and the poisons in the mushroom dissolve their livers.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Please get me some water, quickly.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I realized that the slightest flex of any muscle from my toes to my crotch initiated cramps.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I crawled on my belly, using my arms to pull

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"T H E P R I M A L D I E T
myself around the house."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I urinated into a bottle while lying on the floor.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I carefully and slowly hoisted myself on to the toilet to defecate - as if I were paralyzed from the waist down - after which I was exhausted.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Breathing was exhausting.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Unless I accidentally flexed my lower extremities or grasped either of my hands too tightly, the cycle was every hour."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Like clockwork, twenty minutes conscious taking care of myself, twenty in excruciating cramps and twenty unconscious."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My liver was in constant pain, sometimes mildly, other times severely."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"By the fourth day I had consumed six pounds of unsalted raw butter, two dozen bananas, two dozen raw eggs and eight gallons of water."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Yet I was twenty pounds lighter.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Now I could move my lower half, slowly, without causing cramps."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The cycle jumped to once every four hours.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I went to the neighbor’s yard and dug deep under one of those mushrooms.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I found that it had a cup-like lip one and a half inches below the dirt’s surface.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wondered what had caused these mushrooms to deform.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I figured it had been a chemical fertilizer or weed killer.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had eaten the mushroom nicknamed “Death Cap”.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Several books claimed that every person on record who had eaten a half thumb-sized amount of the mushroom had died.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had eaten fifteen times that.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"One book stated, “Death usually comes within ten days and it is welcomed.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I thought that I would get used to the pain, but I didn’t."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"On the tenth day, the cramps diminished to as few as four a day."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Now Owanza could touch me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She rubbed my feet often, gently and kindly for hours at a
time."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It was the only thing I enjoyed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The cramps continued for ten weeks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I had come almost full circle to
where I had been after my cancer therapies: semi-invalid."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I developed chronic fatigue syndrome again.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If I walked two miles, it took me two weeks to recuperate."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Many days, simple tasks like brushing my teeth took an act of God."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I lost most of my pleasurable sensations.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Before, when I walked in the woods I had felt a connection to every living thing, like feelings one has for loved ones."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It was comforting, invigorating."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Before, I was moved by colors the way music evokes feelings."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Now, I felt nothing from colors or the woods."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was dead and in hell.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Most everything smelled repulsive.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Noise drove me crazy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I remember a hyperactive mockingbird that hung around for weeks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It was all I could do to keep

OUT OF THE GRIPS OF DISEASE AND DEATH 61
from buying a gun and shooting it."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The sound of barking instantly drove me into panic and fury.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I constantly forced myself to be kind and understanding although I felt destructive and chaotic.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had to eat every two hours to keep a semblance of equilibrium but I was never hungry.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After being that way for over three years, I feared I might remain that way for life."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I worked hard at being optimistic.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But often I wanted to die.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I experimented and learned that a little cooked starches in combination with raw fat and fresh fruit could control my depression and rage. (
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This experience inspired me to ponder about how much violence is a result of ill health.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I speculated that most is.)
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Now, almost six years later, I am mostly happy again."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I triumphed over death, against all odds again."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And I healed without being crippled.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As I fall asleep in the warm bath I wonder, again: How will Jeff fare?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If he lives, will he be completely paralyzed?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Will he be happy?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mom and I walk back into Jeff’s hospital room at 4:45 p.m. (twenty- four hours after my arrival).
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I carry a small cooler of food.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"A nurse stands at one side of the bed, Ben sits at the other."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Margaret and a volunteer stand at the end of the bed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Everyone has more energy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They seem optimistic and more relaxed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I feel relieved.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As I pass behind the volunteer, I see that Jeff’s eyes are open."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He sees me and his eyes widen.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,His left eyebrow rises and his mouth opens in a left-sided laugh.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He lifts his left arm, greeting me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Ben smiles but looks hurt.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The nurse looks shocked, and says to no one in particular, “Who’s he that gets such a hello?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Jeff’s lucky, he has two fathers,” Ben says with a tense smile."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,No wonder everyone is more cheerful; Jeff recovered from his coma!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Within moments Jeff falls asleep.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We say our greetings and Mom cuts the tension with light talk.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After the nurse checks Jeff’s vital signs, I
put honey/butter under his tongue."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Another nurse escorts Dr. Braisley into the room.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She nods toward
me, smiles wryly at the doctor and walks out."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Dr. Braisley approaches me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We formally introduce ourselves.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Can we talk in the hall?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,the doctor asks Ben and me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We follow him.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I know it’s a miracle that Jeff’s out of the coma but it may not be a

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"T H E P R I M A L D I E T
blessing."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,His brain damage is extensive.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Although the body can repair the brain, brain cells don’t reproduce like other cells."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff will have very little control over his body.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Last evening, I watched him yank his catheter out."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It took his mother and two nurses to wrest him still,” I counter."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“That was an unconscious body response.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He will have no conscious control.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He won’t be able to take care of himself, even feed himself,” the doctor says and pauses."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“His brain is cleaning and healing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When I walked in today, he smiled and raised his entire left arm and waved at me (even though it looked more like a Nazi salute),” I say, hoping humor will lighten the tension. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And he hasn’t seen me in four years!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,For his brain to assimilate and respond on that data in that manner he can hardly be considered a vegetable.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“He did?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,the doctor asks looking to Ben.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Ben nods, yes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Two-year-olds recognize their parents.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They can wave, smile and
even laugh, but Jeff will never be normal."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He will not have control of his right side.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He will never walk.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I look at Ben and see in his face the memories and hardships that he and Mary experienced with their daughter who had been paraplegic.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She did not properly develop hip bones.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I remember seeing a picture of her with black hair, sprightly look and kind demeanor."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I recall Jeff and Mom telling me that she was always cheerful and sweet.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She died on the operating table when she was six years old.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Although that was ten years ago, the thought of Jeff being crippled seems to regurgitate those feelings in Ben."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I feel angry at the doctor for his hopeless prognosis.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“The fluids that have built up under Jeff’s skull are putting pressure on the brain and causing further damage.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We are going to operate in the morning and drain them.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The idea of them drilling panics me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I take two deep breaths slowly.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The doctor assumes that my pause is agreement, so I blurt out, “It will only create more problems for Jeff to heal.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They look as if I’ve punched them.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The doctor regains composure and says, “I understand your concern but I will drill small holes from which we can draw out the fluids as they build."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This kind of procedure has risk but much to gain.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"OUT OF THE GRIPS OF DISEASE AND DEATH 63
“You told everyone he would die, no question,” I say. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The fluids that are in his brain supply healing nutrients and cleanse dead tissue.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The raw fats I have been giving him have made that natural process possible, and he recovered from his coma."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"With the concentrated raw fat, his body will not call for more fluids than the areas need to cleanse and heal."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"We need to supply the proper nutrients, be patient and let his body heal."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff will get better.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Ben’s face shows shock and fear.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I don’t believe he had ever heard anyone refute a doctor.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Smiling patronizingly, the doctor says, “As I said, it is a miracle that Jeff is out of his coma, but the water on his brain is a fact."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We have to remove it.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Let me share my position with you,” I say getting in his face. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You don’t know the logic of Jeff’s healing, so you call it a bizarre miracle."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But it is a natural miracle.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You know disease and how to attack the body.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You drill it, pound it, poison it, sedate it, trying to eliminate symptoms and not causes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"This may be over-simplification, but the point is infallible: Are people hyperactive because they’re deficient in sedatives?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Do diabetics’ pancreases stop producing insulin because they’re deficient in insulin?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Do people have pain because they’re deficient in aspirin?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff’s brain isn’t swelling with fluids because he needs holes in his head.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff would not be in this hospital if it weren’t for Mary and Ben’s wishes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But be very sure that I will use whatever power I have to stop you from performing any more surgeries on Jeff.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Ben, cringing, remains silent."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Dr. Braisley, flabbergasted, says, “Very well, then."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,If we are going to treat Jeff with diet then we will tube-feed him.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“If we get him sober he can eat,” I say."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“If he isn’t eating solid food within twenty-four hours we will tube- feed him!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I will at least do that,” the doctor says, turns and leaves, ignoring my hint about medication."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Give him a chance,” I say after the doctor."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I know that the foods they will tube-feed Jeff will be too deficient in nutrients for healing but I say no more.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Relax, Ben, that was a victory for Jeff.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Ben walks away without saying anything.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I walk back into Jeff’s room.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I put honey/butter under his tongue.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"A

repairman comes into the anteroom."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He checks the medicine cabinet.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I watch him replace the lock.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wonder if I’ll be able to get back in there.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After the repairman leaves, I make Jeff ten ounces of raw custard."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Jeff, buddy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Wake up and eat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You will heal properly and more easily.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,His eyes open and his mouth drops.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I place a half spoonful of custard on his tongue.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I close his mouth and bring his head level so he won’t choke.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I gently glide my fingers downward along his Adam’s apple
encouraging him to swallow."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He swallows it!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I give him another half spoonful, rub his throat and he swallows."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I
give him another and he swallows but coughs a little."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,His cough grows violent.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He turns red choking.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I take the vacuum hose and insert it deep into his throat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Globs of mucus with the food flow through the tube.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Jeff chokes on the tube as if he will vomit, but I finish clearing his esophagus and he doesn’t."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I give his throat muscles and nerves several minutes to relax.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I feed him another half spoonful.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I gently stroke his throat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He swallows.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He coughs a little and settles.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I give him more.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He coughs violently and chokes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I insert the tube deep and suction the mucus.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He produces mucus faster than I can feed him.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If I suction his throat before every other bite I’ll prevent mucus from blocking his throat, I realize."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But right now I’d better let him relax for four or five minutes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I see that feedings will be long and painful for both of us.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But he is eating!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Ben and Margaret return with coffee.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They stand over Jeff watching him sleep.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff looks exhausted but more relaxed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Jeff kept down about three and a half ounces of custard,” I say. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He choked a lot, but he kept down that much.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Ben and Margaret seem encouraged.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Ben wipes the sweat off of Jeff’s brow.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff would love to be aware of this.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He has always resented Ben’s
aloofness.12 Ben strokes Jeff’s head again affectionately."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He sits and stares at nothing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Should I try to talk with him?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"No, I don’t want Ben to feel comfortable enough with me to counter my wishes with the doctors."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I feed Jeff a little honey/butter to alleviate pain and to continue cleansing
12 SeeAppendixI,page139."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"OUT OF THE GRIPS OF DISEASE AND DEATH 65
his internal wounds."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Would you like to get anything to eat?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Margaret asks me. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I brought food, thank you.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“How about some hot chocolate?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It has milk in it.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“It would make me hyperactive, jittery.13 But I’ll go with you if you’d like.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Yes, that would be nice,” Margaret says and stands."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We walk to Intensive Care lounge without saying a word.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I realize that I haven’t seen Margaret since the day Willy and I built Jeff’s swing when Jeff was two.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The lounge is empty.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We sit.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I fear I’m in for a lecture.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“So, how’s California?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,she asks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I’ve moved away four times but I keep going back to Los Angeles.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"So, except for pollution, I guess it’s still the promised land for me, for now.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I hear you’re on quite a strict diet.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Very politely put, thank you.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I want you to know that I never gave up on you.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Some things just
don’t work out.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“And all these years, like Mary, I thought you despised me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You have
every right to, you know.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Believe me, I know,” she says laughing."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We have a pleasant talk and I repeat a few of the stories I told Mary.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"9
Monday, September 29th
Mary’s arrival wakes me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I reposition my numb and sore bottom on the
chair."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It’s 7 a.m. She and Ben go for coffee.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Rather than awaken Jeff, I put honey/butter under his tongue."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,An attendant brings in a food tray.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The nurse checks Jeff’s vital signs.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,13 Chocolate has theobromine and caffeine - two nerve irritants called stimulants.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"T H E P R I M A L D I E T
Mary returns without Ben and immediately assists the nurse."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary inserts a straw in a carton of orange juice.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I cringe because I know this juice is pasteurized and much more acidic than fresh.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"All of its
enzymes and at least 50% of its vitamins are dead and some radical,14 and the minerals are unstable and radical."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It will give Jeff very little with which to heal and will burn his throat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Jeff!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It’s time to eat something.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"C’mon, drink some juice,” says the nurse waking him."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Jeff, welcome back, boy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Help us out here.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You need to get your strength up.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Sip a little, now,” Mary says."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff sips and immediately chokes violently.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Mary vacuums his
throat. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"That was a good try,” says the nurse."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Try again, Jeff,” Mary says."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff sips and instantly chokes again.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary vacuums his throat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I can’t
stand here and keep my mouth shut, so I go to the anteroom."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I juice several oranges.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I return to Jeff’s bedside and exchange orange juices.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary and the nurse give me looks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Which would you rather drink?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They raise their eyebrows in agreement and feed Jeff the fresh juice.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I go for a walk.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Forty-five minutes later I reenter the room.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary sits on the bed talking to Jeff who mumbles incoherently.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She seems to understand a little but I can’t understand a word.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff dozes off.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I guess Ben told you the doctor said Jeff will be a vegetable,” I
say. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Yes,” Mary says with her eyes filling."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“It doesn’t have to be that way.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The doctors’ prior prognosis was that
he’d definitely die, no question."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They say his brain is permanently damaged.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That’s not necessarily so.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“For example, nine years ago a man named Louis came into Aunt Tilly’s Too, the health food store where I was the nutritionist."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He was a thirty-two-year-old man with a masters degree in Library Science.

approached me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It took him four and a half minutes to ask a simple question.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“At first, I thought he had a severe stuttering problem."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But he didn’t stumble consistently on consonants.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Sometimes he stumbled on vowels.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mostly he stumbled trying to articulate thoughts.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Among his many problems, all of his glands were overactive."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,His nervous system could never keep up with them.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He had low blood sugar and protein levels.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As a result, I assessed he had severe delays between the analytical, decision-making process and motor response."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,So his problem was complex.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Just like Jeff’s.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“After a fifteen minute conversation that took an hour, I presumed that Louis had been this way most of his life."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,His condition was so normal to himself that he had little awareness of his difference from others.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He wondered why he had no real friends.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I thought to myself, who has the time or patience?!"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I did.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“First, I suggested he eat all raw foods and eliminate all of the vitamin, mineral and protein supplements that he consumed.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“You don’t believe in vitamin supplements?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary asks shocked.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I suggest eating fresh foods that are rich in balanced bioactive enzymes, vitamins and minerals for optimal health rather than consuming
supplements.15 Anyway, Louis showed immediate results."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Within six months, a fifteen minute conversation took only forty minutes.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“When did you develop all this patience?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My God, I’d go crazy if I had to listen to someone take forever to have a conversation,” Mary says."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Look back at the patience you had with your daughter.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My patience came with better health.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary nods. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,How’s Louis now?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Patience.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I realized that Louis must have had synapse, axon and/or ganglia damage or mutation."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I deduced that if he ate fresh raw ocean fish and raw organically raised free-range fowl, his body could regenerate and rebuild those nerves.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Yuk,” Mary says."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“An aversion to flesh food is either conceptual or you’re an herbivore.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Herbivores have hooves.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I don’t remember you having hooves.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Mary smiles wryly and says, “It’s the fact that it’s raw!”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“That’s what I said, conceptual."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Although Louis only ate raw fish or

We_Want_To_Live.txt,“What about worms and salmonella?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary says alarmed and repulsed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Intestinal worms do not thrive in healthy cells.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When an intestine becomes excessively toxic and massive tissue degenerates, worms can thrive."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Parasites actually help eliminate dead, weak and dangerous degenerative cells."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They consume these damaged cells and break them down into substances that the body can most easily eliminate.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Or the body can produce virus to dissolve the toxic degenerative tissue, or it can produce a bacterial infection to consume organic degenerative tissue, but those processes usually take more time and are more exhausting."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Parasites are always the best and quickest the body can do to cleanse.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff’s irises indicate he is not in danger of parasites.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Now, regarding salmonella and similar bacteria."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Normally, foods that naturally contain these bacteria produce a putrid odor when the bacterial count gets high."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If you worry about bacteria, when meat stinks don’t eat it."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The bacterial count in cooked meat and eggs will grow as much as sixty times higher than in raw food.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The waste products from bacteria that feeds on cooked food is 10-100 times more toxic than the waste products from bacteria feeding on raw rood.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"That’s why in our advanced society, bacterial food-poisoning is from cooked, packaged or restaurant food."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I will not feed Jeff stinky meat.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I must be as crazy as you.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If it works, do it,” Mary says."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“May I ask you something?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“What?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Why didn’t you want me here?

We_Want_To_Live.txt,I waited months.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The Teamsters said they sent you the check because it was your insurance.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The check had been cashed.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I remember receiving insurance checks regularly for all my medical

We_Want_To_Live.txt,I automatically sent them to the doctors.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"One of my doctors got a hearty, undeserved tip."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Why didn’t you call me?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I could have looked into it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had no idea.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Mary, I would never purposely do anything like that to you and Jeff.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She looks at me, then touches my hand. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You trying to live forever?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“How long isn’t all that important to me.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,I hear Jeff groaning.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He sounds far

We_Want_To_Live.txt,I awaken from a dream to find myself in a chair at Jeff’s bedside.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He thrashes about.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"With his left hand, he pulls at the boards binding both hands and arms."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I look around.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Thank God no one is here to see this.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Jeff, please."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If you pull your tubes and all, the nurses and doctors will sedate you."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Or they’ll give you a paralyzing drug.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You won’t be able to eat to get well.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It’s okay to thrash about if only I am here but please don’t pull your tubes.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He continues thrashing but stops pulling at the boards.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Great, that’s good exercise.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I place my fingers in his left palm.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Can you grip my fingers?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Squeeze, let me feel your strength.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,His grip is shaky with little strength but he does it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Terrific, you’re controlling some movements!"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Now squeeze my fingers with your right hand.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,His hand doesn’t respond.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He furrows his brow despondently.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“It’s okay.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Give it time.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Your car won’t recover but you will.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Should I be telling him that, I wonder."

schizophrenic and depressed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He had been to doctors and they told him that cures were rare and that a lifetime of medication was his only solution.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Several years later doctors convinced him that thyroid removal might help.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It did briefly.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then he was labeled incurable and forever dependent on thyroid hormones and antidepressants.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I failed Lanny before doctors convinced him to let them remove his thyroid.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was still a diehard fruitarian/vegetarian.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had encouraged him to fast and follow a raw fruitarian/vegetarian diet.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,His digestion improved.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He felt better.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But he was prone to low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I didn’t realize then - I was this ignorant - that a fruitarian or vegetarian diet is often rapid debilitation for people with hypoglycemia.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Fasting - starving the body - is rapid debilitation for almost every body.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Nor did I recognize at the time that hypoglycemia
and protein deficiency are the main cause of depression.17
My suggestions were more harmful than helpful to Lanny."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Lanny has not been open to my suggestions since.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He continues to suffer terribly unless heavily medicated.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"With or without medication, the most he can do is take care of his basic needs."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He cannot work.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I miss his vitality,

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Jeff, can you move your left leg?"

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"But, basically, the romance ended when my senses died with the poisonous mushroom."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“When my sexuality returned five years later, it was not for Owanza."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Until a few months ago, when you and I met, that kind of affection was something I thought had ended for me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I can’t transfer my passion for you on to Owanza.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It would be debilitating and fruitless to try to be a bird of paradise if what I am is a sunflower,” I joke."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Hi, sunflower."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Do you want to shine on me?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Beatriz says, leaning on me and nibbling my ear."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Can you take the heat?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Beatriz wets her lips and kisses me with her mouth open while pulling me down on top of her.

The next day, Friday; Back in Cincinnati
I am feeling sprightly after my two-hour nap on the plane."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I amble
down the hall to Jeff’s new room."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I enter, “Hi, kiddo, it’s Johnny!"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Direct from Los Angeles,” I say imitating the Johnny Carson Show."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The room is empty of visitors. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Now that you’re in a regular room, no one stays with you?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Hhii.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,The right side of his face is still predominantly paralyzed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I find it hard to look at him.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I will get used to it again. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I used to get paranoid when they gave me medication that lowered my blood pressure.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I thought the sky was falling on me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I knew this would happen to you, so I slowly melted some unsalted raw butter and blended in some fresh garlic and mixed it with some raw pâté that I made."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,All before I boarded the plane.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Jeff slowly moves his left hand to my chest, grasps my shirt and pulls me toward him."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I am just noticing that neither of his arms are taped to boards.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Tthheirrr ttrryyiiinnn’ tooo kkkkkiiilll mmeee.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I’m back, and I assure you, they won’t get away with it.”"

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Wow, you really have improved."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Jeff, what I meant was, I’m not
going to let them kill you."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I think the fear you feel is biological.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Your blood-pressure is too low.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Open your mouth and eat this.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The danger you are feeling will pass.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Chew or mix it around in your mouth so saliva will thin it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It will be easier to swallow.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Are you conscious enough to do all of this without me talking you through it?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff shakes his head no.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Then I’ll talk you through it when I see you distracted, okay?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He nods.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“The hospital personnel are not purposely trying to kill you.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They
simply don’t understand the subtle disasters that lowering your blood- pressure causes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,What they normally do is counter danger-symptoms of fear and panic with a drug that’ll dope you.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had been sabotaging that drug before I left.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I’m sorry I couldn’t get here an hour sooner or I

could have sabotaged the injection again."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But the flight was late.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Before I give you another bite I’ll put some honey in the pâté.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If the body needs its temperature raised, unheated honey with raw meat and/or raw butter will raise it."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It’ll be about twenty minutes before it takes effect.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,So please be patient.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ll get you another blanket.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You want to hear a joke?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Yyeess.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Since you’ll be getting out of here soon and coming to visit me, I’ll tell you a traveler’s joke.”"

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The passenger approaches a ticket agent
and says, ‘Send this bag to Hong Kong, that one to Honolulu and the last one to Fiji.’ ‘"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"We can’t do that, sir."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You’re only going to Los Angeles.’ ‘
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Well, you did the last time I was here."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Oooooohhh.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Ooowww.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I know, it only hurts when you laugh."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,No more jokes for you.” “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Ooowww.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Ooww.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Ooohh.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,An hour passes and Jeff is completely calm and warm.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"A stout woman enters, says, “Hi, Jeff."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m Adele.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m your speech therapist.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We’ll be working together until you’re well enough to leave the hospital and go to a rehabilitation facility.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We’ll start off working thirty minutes or more.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Or until you become too tired.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Adele seems annoyed with my presence and says to me, “Jeff and I need to be alone, would you be so kind?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Thank you.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Jeff, I want you to say the word day.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Feeling a bit insulted I leave and walk to the anteroom. “

We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Dthaaaa.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Better.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Put your tongue a little higher on the roof of your mouth.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Daaay.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Excellent.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You know, you may never be the fast talker you were before, but that’ll be kind of sexy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Be patient.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I have to be, so it’s only fair you be patient with me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A deal?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Yyyeaasss.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Adele looks over at me in the anteroom, rises, comes over, gives me a look, closes the lavender mini-blinds and walks back to Jeff."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Wow, she doesn’t like me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I feel hurt and I don’t even know her!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"An hour later I return to Jeff’s room, “Did Adele wear you
out?” “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Yyyeass.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Hi, Jeff,” a voice comes resounding from behind me, startling me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I
step aside."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A large African-American gentleman in a hospital uniform passes me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Owning the room with his presence, he says to Jeff, “I’m Harold."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ll be your physical therapist while you’re here.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Looks like your easy days of lying around are over.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You ready to get that body back to doing something?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Would you like me to leave?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I’m Harold, who might you be?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I’m Aajonus, like homogenous without the hum."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I’m one of Jeff’s
fathers."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The biological one.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“What did you do, become a father at seven years old?!” “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Seventeen years old.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“What is your secret?!”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“You don’t want to hear.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Gotcha.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff and I’ll work an hour or two a day.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If you work some
with him, it’s better you do it right."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,So watch and learn.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Thank you, I appreciate that."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"We’ll have Jeff dancing from this
hospital,” I say."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"OUT OF THE GRIPS OF DISEASE AND DEATH 89
Harold gives me a distressed look."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Then he looks to Jeff and says, “Your nervous system has been badly damaged, Jeff."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"So, we are working with limitations."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We’d all better come to the realization right now that you’ll probably never dance.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But we’ll get you moving as much as we can.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We might even get you on a walker some day.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Maybe.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We’ll just do the very best we can.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,So try real hard.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Okay?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Yyeass.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Harold, if I sound offensive, understand and forgive me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Just let me take one minute to tell Jeff about Oscar (one of my clients).”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Go for it.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Jeff, Oscar was twenty-two (your age) when he came to me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He had knee injuries.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He was a ski instructor and loved skiing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The doctors said that he must have surgery or he would have a lot of trouble and pain for the rest of his life.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They told him that with or without surgery he would never ski again.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Oscar refused surgery.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I suggested a diet that was heavy in raw eggs, raw meat with unsalted raw butter, no-salt- added raw cheese, avocado, raw milk, and a little raw fruit and raw germinated grains.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Harold gives me a strange look but I continue, “Within nine months Oscar was back to skiing like a mad man."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Within eighteen months he won two ski ribbons in Switzerland.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Oscar healed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You can heal too, Jeff."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Your muscles don’t have to atrophy like normal brain-damaged accident victims.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You’ll regain connection to your muscles as quickly as you heal the damaged nerve connections.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Okay, Harold."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Thanks.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Harold swallows an impulse to call me nuts.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He looks at me pitifully.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He looks at Jeff, “Let’s see what you can do."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Move your right arm.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff’s arm doesn’t move. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Keep trying, it may take a while before enough messages get to the motor center and down to your arm.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Jeff clinches his teeth and buckles his chin to his neck, trying."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But he can’t do it. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"That’s okay, don’t get discouraged,” Harold says."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“He lifted it an inch two days ago.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Twice.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Let’s see the left arm move,” Harold says."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff easily curls his left arm. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Good, my man."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"With a little work, looks like you could play hard ball with that one."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Now turn it back and forth.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Twist at the wrist,” Harold continues."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"14
Next afternoon, Saturday, October 4th
I walk down the hall past nurses, orderlies, patients, visitors and doctors on the way to Jeff’s room."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Aajonus,” the nurse calls."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I stop and approach the nurses' station.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“My shift ends in about thirty minutes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Did you forget to tell me what
Jeff ate last night and so far today?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Oh, yes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Three ounces of fish, four ounces beef, half cup of potatoes,
8 tablespoons of butter, four ounces of honey, cup of custard, six ounces fruit juice and six ounces of water."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He still coughs a little but I only had to vacuum his throat twice.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Very impressive.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Word’s around that you’re feeding him raw eggs and meat,” she angles."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I would have to say...that is very true.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Raw, or should I say, live foods, are what have made Jeff’s progress impressive."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Potato is the only thing I’ve fed him that’s been cooked.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She glares at me without saying anything.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Is there something else you want to know?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She smiles wily and I get a bad feeling.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She gestures no.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Excuse me, then."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m going to see if Jeff needs anything.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I’ve been
gone several hours."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Have a pleasant evening.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Are you working tomorrow?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“My husband and I are going to my mother’s for dinner,” she asserts."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Why is being friendly often considered a come-on?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"To make my intention clear, I say, somberly, “I wish you and your family a
wonderful day off together, Mrs.
McCauley.” “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Thank you.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As I amble into Jeff’s room, I take a playful ape-like posture to amuse
Jeff."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I see a pretty, petite young lady with light hair sitting in Jeff’s room."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I straighten up, embarrassed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She looks familiar.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She stands as I come closer.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I notice Jeff sleeping.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Hi, I’m Stacey,” she says with a fraught smile."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"90

“Jeff’s fiancée!”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I say, remembering her from the picture Jeff sent me of them at Stacey’s prom. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m Aajonus.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m happy to meet you.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Does Jeff know you’re here?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Yes, but he fell asleep.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“He’s pretty drained,” I say."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Jeff talked a lot about you.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“He did?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wonder from whom he got his information.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“That’s true, you certainly haven’t been around for him to get it first
hand,” she says playfully."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I’m Ralph,” says a young man, who stands to greet me, “Jeff and I
were best friends.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Jeff is no longer considered dead, so I assume you’re still best
friends,” I say jovially."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Ralph gives Stacey a noncommittal look that frightens me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Jeff hasn’t had a relapse in the last six hours, has he?!”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I dart over to
Jeff."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He sleeps quietly.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“No, he’s doing okay,” Stacey says."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Have you talked to him?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“He’s hard to understand but he recognizes us,” Stacey says and
hesitates, “But I think he’s completely forgotten what he did.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“What do you mean?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“You don’t know?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Stacey asks rhetorically, wishing she hadn’t
mentioned it."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“What do you know?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Ralph asks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“He lost control of his car and went down a ravine.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Did you know he was carrying a loaded revolver when it
happened?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Ralph asks. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,No.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Maybe we’d better sit down,” Ralph says empathically."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A chill runs up and down my spine.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Stacey begins, “The night before the accident, Jeff and I got in a fight about something that happened a few days ago."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The three of us had been hanging out at Ralph’s house.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff and I were fooling around inside.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Ralph was by the pool.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff was drinking a lot and getting crazy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He went into one of the bedrooms to sleep it off.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I went out to the pool.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I gave Ralph a harmless, friendly kiss."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Jeff saw us and snapped, got crazy jealous."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Accused Ralph and me of having an affair.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I was

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"T H E P R I M A L D I E T
engaged to Jeff and Ralph was his best friend!”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Then Ralph says, “We tried to reason with him."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He said he’d been
watching Stacey and me together for a long time."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That we were getting along too well to be just friends.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Accused me of fucking Stacey.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was his best friend!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Called her a slut.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She was his fiancée!”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Stacey resumes the story, “An hour or so before the accident, I called and told Jeff that I’d filed a police report against him for hitting me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He just kept saying things like, ‘You’re fucking Ralph, aren’t you, you whore?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ll kill you.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You can’t do this to me, you bitch.’"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I told him he was insane and I hung up.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Then he called me,” Ralph says, “and he said, ‘I’m comin’ to kill both of you!’"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Next thing we knew, his mother called to tell us he had had an accident."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The police called to ask how much he’d had to drink, about some drugs and the loaded gun.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Wow,” I say."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I remember my jealousy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If Mary were even ten minutes late, I imagined that she was screwing around with a salesman at work."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I reasoned that the salesman had more education, intelligence and money than I and could easily seduce her."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I trembled with fury.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I never had the guts to talk to anyone, even Mary, about my ridiculous fears and jealousy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Thank my lucky stars, I didn’t become an alcoholic until after Mary and I separated."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Although I was a happy drunk.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was nasty only when I was sober.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I feel disoriented, fearful, angry and sad."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,How am I going to put this in some compassionate and practical perspective?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Is an accident all that separates my son from being a murderer?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It doesn’t matter, Jeff has not killed anyone!"

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Hi, Jeff,” Stacey says sympathetically."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I can see whatever romantic feelings she had for him are dead now.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wonder if she will be able to tell him.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I have to go now,” Stacey says and turns to me, “It was nice meeting you.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Thank you.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Me too.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Jeff knows
that something is very wrong."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Sadly he watches her go.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Tears fill his eyes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He crossed the line.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It is over and he knows it.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,He slides his legs to the side of the bed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Margaret and I help Jeff position himself on the edge.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We take him by the arms.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We get ready to move him to the wheel chair.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Let him try,” I say, knowing very well that he has only slight movement in his right side. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,If you think you can walk we’ll help you.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Let him.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He won’t know unless he tries.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You never know,” I say

argue with him."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I am sabotaging his medication, so he is not drugged and he will remember."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff lifts himself by pushing with his left arm.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I help balance him on his feet. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Can you feel both feet on the floor?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Yeesss,” he says with more air than voice."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He has that look infants have when they first try standing on their own.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I can see he is convincing himself that he can do it. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Okaaay, le’ go.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Just to be safe, can you step forward with your right foot?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He slides it forward very slowly and shakily. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m impressed!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Now can you put your weight on it while you lift your left leg forward?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He gives me a frustrated look. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I know, people can walk very well until they’re asked to think about it."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"But I’m just trying to help you explore your strength, or lack of it.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Le’ meee go, nouw!”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Okay, we’re letting you go very slowly,” I say."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Jeff stands on his own, shakily."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I reach for a pillow to throw under
him in case he falls."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He bends his left knee.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He shifts his weight on to his right side and collapses.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He crashes to the floor before I can get the pillow under him.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,His reflexes are so slow his arms don’t brace the fall.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He lands hard.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I cringe.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A lump forms on his brow as fast as my ego shrinks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Margaret and I lift him up.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We put him into the wheel chair.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Iii ccaann’t doo it,” he says embarrassed, grieved and humbled."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“It’s okay.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Now you know for sure.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Take your time, work with the therapist and you’ll be walking in no time."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The doctors say you will never walk again.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Take what they say very lightly.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They don’t know what we know,” I say."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Whhat do wee knnoww?”

We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was trying to lighten us up.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I want to talk to you about something and I’m afraid to.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But here it goes.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Next afternoon, Monday, October 6th
A gray-suited, gaunt, thin, austere, somewhat anxious man enters Jeff’s room and looks around."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I have a bad feeling about him. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff has gone to physical therapy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Are you another doctor?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask with trepidation that he might be.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I am the president of this hospital.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You are Age-ee-nees?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Hi.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It’s Aajonus.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I extend my hand.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We shake hands.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He furtively wipes his hand on his pants.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I surmise that he is terribly germ phobic.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Either his immune system is very low, or he has allergies or he’s just paranoid."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I understand you have brought raw meat and eggs into this hospital,” he says confrontationally."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Is there a problem?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Raw meat and eggs carry disease.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They don’t belong anywhere in this hospital, except the kitchen."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In fact, for sanitation, no meat or eggs come into this hospital raw."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Everything but fresh fruit is processed,” he says with pride and authority."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Hospital food is the most processed and denatured.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Is that something to be proud of?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Does it have any life to give sick people?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I want you to remove all raw food from the hospital.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He waits glaringly for my acceptance.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“May I say something about the disease theory?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Those bacteria show up in lab tests.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“All of us have the syphilis germ within us, like meat has bacteria."

higher than in raw meat and eggs before it produces a putrid odor."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The waste produced by bacteria feeding on cooked food is extremely toxic.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"That’s why bacterial food-poisoning in this country is from cooked, packaged or restaurant food."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I could not find one laboratory test that proved bacteria living on raw meat caused food-poisoning in animals who ate it.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Are you going to remove what I asked?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Would you stop doing something for your son that has been helpful and working because I asked you to?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Not likely.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Then may I have a little latitude, please."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Decades of research documents and photographs held by the Price-Pottenger Foundation in La Mesa, California, prove that raw meat, raw dairy and raw foods in general create excellent health, free of disease."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Shall I call security?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Fresh raw meat promotes cellular reproduction, good health and vitality.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I’m not going to argue the issue.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The facts as I know them are that raw meat and eggs cause disease.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Now, if you don’t remove those items, I will have security come and do it."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And you with it.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Please.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My son’s life is at stake.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The doctors said my son would be a vegetable, living off machines."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When Jeff’s progress shattered that prognosis, they said he would be paralyzed and have the mind of a two- year-old."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Look what the raw meat and eggs have done.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The raw foods continued to heal him and have made that prognosis obsolete.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He raises his voice, “The medication and everything the doctors and nurses have done in this hospital have saved your son!”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I can’t tell him that I sabotaged the medication.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"And arguing that all the hospital has done was to house, butcher, radiate and drug Jeff, would get me thrown out."

“Let me ask one more thing, please.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He shakes his head disgustedly but lets me talk.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“How would it look if the media got a hold of this miracle story and it
said that the president of this hospital risked a young man’s life by changing what had been working?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,How many people would be willing to come to your hospital?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Don’t threaten me.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Actually, it was intended as a wake-up call,” I say trying to lighten the air."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Don’t try my patience any longer.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Take that raw food out of my hospital!”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I am pissed but I know that more argument would be detrimental. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Take it easy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I’ll take it to the car,” I say knowing very well that I will sneak it in later."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I lift my cooler and carry it from the hospital.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Two hours later
Jeff and Harold have just finished physical therapy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Harold leaves.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Mary, on a long lunch break from work, sits reading a magazine."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff watches TV.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I read a book.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,How much more typical can we look.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The nurse enters and examines Jeff.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Her face curls comically from Jeff’s body odor.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She playfully says, “Now that you’re doing so well and you’ve had your exercise, how about a shower?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We can give you a thorough scrubbing.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“That sounds good.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Les go,” Jeff says with a big smile."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Wow, you’re speaking so well already,” she remarks."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I know,” Jeff says, now sounding a little like John Wayne - slow-
talking and gravel-voiced. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Isn’t it amazing?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I’ll say,” she says."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“And the hits just keep comin’,” Mary says mirthfully."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“We’ll have to wait for an orderly to take you to the shower; you’re
too heavy for me,” says the nurse."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I’ll help,” I say."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Then les go,” the nurse says."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"We help Jeff scoot to the side of the
bed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Do you want to try walking the two steps to the wheel chair?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I ask

wryly."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Are you crazy?!”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff says.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Tears come to my eyes. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Are you all
right?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,he asks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I’m just happy you’re healing so fast.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“So am I,” he says."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I move the wheel chair back a few feet and say, “Okay, the nurse and
I will get under your arms so you can simulate walking; just to give you the sensation, okay?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The nurse and Mary give me wry looks. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"We’ll take two small steps, all together we’ll turn around, take two small steps backward and sit you in the chair."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Ready?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We move like a slow and clumsy chorus line but we all feel exhilaration.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Ten minutes later, I lift and carry Jeff from the wheel chair into the shower stall."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I place him on a stool with his left hand at the bar-handle on the wall. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Can you hold yourself up?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“No problem,” Jeff says."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I remove his gown.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Is this like an automatic car wash, or are we gonna get wet?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"We’ll get soaked,” the nurse says."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“You may have other clothes here but I don’t.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Therefore, I’m getting
naked."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If a healthy naked man bothers you, I can wash him alone.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I’ll see you later,” she says with a wry salacious grin."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She gracefully
turns and walks out."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“You keep this progress going and you’ll be home in no time,” I say
as I remove my clothes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I’ll do the best I can.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean that to rush you."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I meant to be
encouraging.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I appreciate it and all you’re doin’ for me, Dad.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He seems to like calling me Dad as much as I like hearing it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I have
no illusions about it, with all due respect, Ben has been his father."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The next morning, Tuesday, October 7th
Jeff sits in bed nonchalantly eating a bowl of raw ground beef with butter only."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I realize I should have put honey in it when all of a sudden his eyes widen and his mouth twists.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"OUT OF THE GRIPS OF DISEASE AND DEATH 99
“This is raw!”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,he says.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary and I exchange looks and break into laughter.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff puts down the bowl.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I can put some honey in it to make it more appealing.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“But this is raw.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“You’ve been eating that for seven days.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It’s what has helped you
heal so well and quickly.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I’m not eating that raw!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That’s raw meat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m no savage.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Would you please keep it down.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The hospital banned me from
bringing raw meat in here,” I whisper, still laughing. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I would not force you to eat anything that isn’t appealing to you.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I appreciate that.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A nurse comes in and I go for the bowl of meat. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I’ll clean your bowl,” I say and furtively pass it by the nurse."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,In the anteroom I put the meat back in the jar and inside a sack.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I return to Jeff and see the nurse leaning over him.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She arranges something I can’t see.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Jeff strokes her bottom and says, “You’re very nice to me, thank you.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Jeffrey Marshall!”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"the nurse says shocked, pushing his hand
away."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary and I exchange looks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“That boy is definitely okay, now,” Mary says. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Jeff, you don’t do
things like that!”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Why not?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It feels good,” Jeff says innocently."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“You don’t touch people unless they want you to touch them.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"All
right?!”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mary says.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Jeff looks at the nurse and says, “Can I touch you?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Absolutely not,” she says."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“How about a kiss?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,he teases.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“You know what this means, Jeff?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I
ask. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,What?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“When the nurses have to put up with your sexual harassment, your
ass is on the way out of this hospital."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Unless you want them to give you a drug to make your sexual organ limp.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“They’d do that to me?!”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Without the bat of an eye,” says the nurse. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Tomorrow or the next day, you’ll be sent to Good Samaritan Hospital where they have a terrific physical rehabilitation unit.”"

We_Want_To_Live.txt,I have to get back to work or I might not have a roof over my head next month.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“You have to go?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff asks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I’ve done all I can.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Do you want me to stay just to watch the nurses slap your sweet face?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m leaving you two six-pound jars of unheated honey and four pounds of unsalted raw butter.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Remember, they will help you get well, so eat lots of them."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The honey helps you digest, utilize and assimilate nutrients and the butter will minimize infection, cleanse dead cells and other waste and make what you have strong."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Raw meat, if you ever eat it, will help your body replace the cells killed as a result of the accident."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eat them together or with whatever you like.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Just don’t cook or put them in or on food that’s hotter than your touch can take.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You got it, kid?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Yes, sir,” he says comically."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Good-bye, Mary,” I say and hug her."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I may be imagining this, but I think her eyes are tearing up."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I turn and go to Jeff.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I give him a hug and kiss on the cheek. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Call me anytime.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If you need anything I can help you with, especially your health, call me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Take care of yourself.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I love you.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I love you too.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You take care.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Thanks.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,He is just waking from fifteen hours of sleep.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He moves as if acutely intoxicated, literally moving in slow-motion, wearing only baggy briefs."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The right side of his body is retarded, including his face slightly."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He straps a small electrical device to his right hand and wrist.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It sends mild currents to stimulate the dormant nerves.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He attempts to stand.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He falls back on to the bed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He does this six times.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Finally, with tremendous determination and effort, he moves to his feet."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He stands wavering in slow-motion for three minutes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then he gets somewhat sure-footed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He realizes he can’t move with the hand device strapped on.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He removes it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He scuffles across the hardwood floor toward the bathroom.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He moves as if he were a hundred-year-old man in a young-looking body.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He disappears into the hall.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I expected him to be so much better, the way you described his progress in the hospital,” Beatriz says."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Me, too."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The few times we talked on the phone he must have been at his best.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He always talked slowly, but I had no idea."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Healing has reduced to a crawl if at all.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He’s been here five days and I can’t get myself to talk to him about his condition.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He has improved a little since he’s been here, eating the raw custard and raw foods."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But I need to talk to him about meat and his medication.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I feel like a father who doesn’t deserve to be a father.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Yet I can’t watch him flounder through life like this.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I must sound like someone who needs a shrink.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Am I being selfish, wanting him to be better?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“You always care just enough about everybody.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But you nag me about my diet a little too much.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I know.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ll work on trusting that you can manage your life by yourself.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Sometimes I have difficulty watching people hurt themselves.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Not that they have to care for themselves the way I do.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,He has to be taking medication for him to sleep this much and move around like a drunk trying to be sober.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,“The doctors said I would have seizures and I’d have to start all over again.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Or die!”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“If you will eat lots of raw fat every day for a month, then at least every other day for six months more, you will never have to worry about seizures."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If you will also eat raw meat at least twice weekly for one year, I figure that you’ll be completely normal again."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It could take less time but you’ve been taking Dilantin for four and a half months.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Drugs interfere with healing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They are often just toxic enough to usurp most of the blood nutrients without causing trauma.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,So no one is conscious enough to realize the harm they do.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Very few people respond well.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And even fewer don’t have side effects from medication.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Medication is the Great Risk.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“The risk of you getting in a car and having an accident on your way
to get a six-pack is astronomical compared to the remote chance that you would have a seizure if you would eat as I’ve suggested.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“The doctor really got on Mom’s case about making sure I take the Dilantin.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He said one seizure and it’s all over again.”

We_Want_To_Live.txt,If you do it while you’re here I will monitor you.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I guarantee that that isn’t necessary.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"But if it will put you at ease, I’m here for you."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Let me tell you about a client with a similar circumstance.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Barbara was a talented singer who had been diagnosed as incurably manic depressive and schizophrenic.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She was suicidal unless medicated.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I think she was twenty-seven when Owanza and I began counseling her.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She had been on medication for nine years and hadn’t been able to work in all that time.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Her parents supported her.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I really didn’t get the point of her medication because she was still extremely depressed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Maybe it disoriented her enough to keep her from killing herself.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I would have preferred death to a life like that.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Jeff, I see you suffering and I ask myself, ‘Will you hate me for helping to save your life if you don’t get any better than this?’ ”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff ponders the question.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He doesn’t comment.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Anyway, since Barbara had been on medication for so long, Owanza and I suggested she wean herself off it over three months."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"First, she cut her dosage in half for a month."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then in half again for another month.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And in half again for the final month.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,By the end of her first year off medication she had written five hundred songs and was recording a few.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“But I’m different, I have physiological damage.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“On the correct diet for your body, it can heal."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I won’t be a nag about it, so I doubt I will mention it more than twice after this."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After that, you’ll have to ask me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"And I’ll help you, without any I-told-you-so."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Just ask.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I love you, Jeff.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I’ll think about it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ll probably do it but I need to get my head in the right place first.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ll be here a little over three more weeks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Will that be enough time?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Easily.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ll wait three days before I mention it again.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Thanks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,How many days do you think I have to eat the fats before I can stop taking medication?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Three to five days.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You are already there.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The unsalted raw butter and raw eggs I’ve been putting in your custard and banana smoothies have already prepared you.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Now it’s up to you.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Good.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Help
yourself.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Thanks.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Jeff pauses, then says. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I would like us to get to know each
other."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Talk about what we’ve been through.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I was going to suggest something like that.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"But since a lot of my past
is unpleasant, I’d prefer talking about what we like and don’t like."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,See what we have in common.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“That sounds good,” he says fading out."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He looks barely in touch with this world.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He sways like a palm in the wind as he sits down on the toilet, exhausted."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“The orange juice, egg and cream in your hand will bring you back to life if you’ll drink it,” I tease."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Oh, yeah,” he says chuckling."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He drinks it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I’m speaking at a cancer support group this evening.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Would you like to see what your old man really cares about?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I’d like that.”

The soft lighting sprays warm highlights and shadows on the thirty-three

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I can barely see Jeff sitting back in a corner in the shadows where he felt he wanted to be, alone."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,All eyes are riveted on me while I’m being introduced.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I feel comfortable with it; the prospect that I might be helpful is exciting,

OUT OF THE GRIPS OF DISEASE AND DEATH 105
especially with Jeff here."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I look into everyone’s eyes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Please, welcome Aajonus,” Pamela concludes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I stand and receive their warm applause.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“You may sit.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"We like everyone to feel at home,” Pamela says as she
sits to my left near the stone fireplace."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The fire burns low.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Her living room is decorated with antique furniture and knickknacks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I’d prefer standing for awhile, thank you."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"First, I would like to introduce you to my son, Jeff."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We’ve been separated for most of his life.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Please stand, Jeff.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He stands somewhat uncomfortably.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Jeff is recovering from a near-fatal accident.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"What I mean by that is, four doctors said it was impossible for him to live because of the brain damage he suffered."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But here he stands due to good nutrition.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,So there is more hope for health than doctors know about.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Thank you, Jeff."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Sorry for embarrassing you.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“It’s okay.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It seems like it could be helpful,” he says and sits."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The room is so quiet I can hear people breathing and the gas hissing as it passes through the pipe before it burns in the fireplace.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“When I was dying of cancer seventeen years ago - actually, I was dying from medical treatments for cancer - I met a man who drank the juice from carrots."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Can you imagine?!”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Almost everyone laughs or chuckles.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“He told me about a woman who’d cured herself of cancer with carrot juice.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She had written a book about it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I scoffed at the idea.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I mean, anyone who could drink carrot juice, I thought, couldn’t have everything in her head in place.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,There are more laughs.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I hated cooked carrots, and I’d never eaten one raw."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eventually, he got me to taste the carrot juice."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It was delicious.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Something clicked in my head with that sip.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Instantly, I linked health and diet together."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Within weeks I went to a health food store and purchased eight books that had some reference to cancer and diet.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I didn’t get--”
“This is hoopla."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Carrot juice.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,If it were that easy these people wouldn’t be here!”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,a skeptical voice from the far side says.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Gabe, you agreed to keep an open mind."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Do you have any answers?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"No, you don’t."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I’m just

We_Want_To_Live.txt,You have a right to be cynical.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We’ve all been conditioned to depend on doctors for our health.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They’ve failed us.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As I said, the carrot juice incident got me to link diet and health together."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I didn’t cure myself with carrot juice alone.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I don’t know how many people here can heal themselves with the diet-logic I’ve devised.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But it has been my experience that it works for everyone who does it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,For as long as he or she stays with it.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The tension dissolves.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A hand from the darkest shadow next to Jeff rises and I call on her or him.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“My name’s Jill,” a teenage girl’s wounded voice
says. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Hi, Jill.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She leans forward and I see her face.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The tension is extreme around
her eyes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I recognize that below her baseball cap she is bald from chemotherapy, which has also made her puffy and pallid with large dark circles around her sunken red eyes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I also see traces of radiation burn.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Seeing her brings back my image after I had had devastating radiation and chemo therapies.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I’d like to know why I got cancer so young.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Do you know why you got cancer so young?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,she asks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I avoid remembering.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“But don’t you think burying it causes cancer?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I mean, some people say it does,” Sarah asks very sensitively."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Not necessarily.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My experience has been that stress usurps massive amounts of nutrients.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As long as we eat enough live raw nutrients, stress will not weaken our bodies.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Your stress must not have been as great as mine, then,” Jill
says. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That may be true.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But does that negate what I just said?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Why don’t you want to get it out?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Doesn’t it eat at you?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"demands
an elderly woman to my right."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She has black circles in her sunken eyes and is bone thin.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She wears heavy make-up and an elegant scarf covering her baldness.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Again, I recognize the effects of chemotherapy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The sight of her brings me to tears.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Talking about it won’t change my past.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ve made peace with it and I move on from here.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,When I was young I was always sick.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Now I’m

healthy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,What more is there?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I think if you’d let it out you’d be even healthier,” says a man
confrontationally."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I see the fresh burns on his neck and face from radiation therapy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I cringe.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I remember how sore and tender my flesh was after radiation treatments.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I would agree, if I were bitter about my past."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But I’m not a victim anymore.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The past was.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My present is mainly what I make it,” I say."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“If you made your peace with it, it shouldn’t bother you to face it,” Gabe mocks me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I notice Jeff and Pamela getting angry for me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I’m sorry, this isn’t going well, Aajonus."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,What’s the matter with all of you?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He’s come to give us what he has to offer.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Please,” Pamela says anguished."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I want to hear the whole story,” Jill, the teenage girl, demands."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Pamela rises and stands in front of the fireplace, “Aajonus is going to leave if you--”
“It’s okay."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ll give you some highlights as I remember them.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I was born in a pile of shit and wherever I went, if there was another pile within fifty miles, my feet found it.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Everyone laughs except Gabe.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“By the way, Jill, where did you get all that information about me?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You seem to know more about me than I do.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“One of your clients told me,” Jill says."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I pause.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I take a deep breath bracing myself. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I feel like I need to hold a flash card that says: Some people may be too sensitive to hear the following story.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It contains vivid and explicit details.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Everyone laughs, even Gabe."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I sit on the couch to cushion myself.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I have never told anyone the stories that led to me getting cancer.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Should I be doing this?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I just told Jeff today I didn’t want to talk about my past.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And here I go.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I was the third born of four boys.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That was at least two too many for Mom and Dad.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They were always too busy with basics to give us the necessary emotional and psychological attention.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I wasn’t fond of the wooden mobile because it was painted stark primary colors, so I chewed on my hand."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,“He reached through the bars and pinched my thigh slowly until I screamed and cried.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The pain was excruciating.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,If I could talk I could prosecute him before my parents.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He made sure I was too afraid to talk.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This caused me to be borderline autistic and severely dyslexic.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Schools worsened my problems.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mom is Catholic and put us in Catholic schools.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The nuns in my first and second grades ridiculed me and smacked me with rulers because I couldn’t read a word.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I thought the whole world was full of raving maniacs.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They solved their problems - so they thought - with intimidation and violence.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“At age seven, I decided that I would make Doug my friend."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But his animosity was immense.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He continued to hurt me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The constant stress and abuse drained and weakened me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I got sick more often as the years passed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Excuse me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I have to catch my breath.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I feel as if I’m going to cry.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Crying in private was the only release from my childhood traumas.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Crying felt so good that I still cry, or at least tear up, from pain, joy, tenderness, and just about anything that touches me deeply.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Three women come and hug me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I start to weep.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We weep together.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Another woman and Jill join in the hug, weeping."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff joins us.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Then, everyone but Gabe joins in."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I begin to laugh.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then I break down crying.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I feel like a water pipe with no valve to turn me off.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Would somebody please turn me off?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I joke.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Everyone laughs. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Okay,” I sniffle. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Let’s try to get through this in one piece.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Let’s see.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"So, my being compassionate and understanding with Doug rarely helped our relationship."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He accused me of trying to be a saint.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He said I was really the devil.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He called attention to my anger.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I felt my anger.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It felt destructive.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I began to believe that I was evil.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“At age eight, I stopped trying to be his friend."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I became brazen enough to try to communicate with Mom and Dad that he was hurting me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They repeatedly told me, ‘You must have done something to make

OUT OF THE GRIPS OF DISEASE AND DEATH 111
him hurt you.’"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I wanted to sass back, ‘Yes, I was born!’"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I hadn’t learned the sound patterns to express my concepts.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Then at age ten, a light of inspiration struck."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I took on Doug’s criminal attitude.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I immersed myself in his emotions the way an actor does.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I became the frustration, the anger, the hostility."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was a better thief than he was.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He shared in the loot.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I fought and beat other kids.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He enjoyed it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Sometimes I flipped.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I waved a knife at him.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Or my Knights of Columbus sword.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Or a BB gun.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,At those moments he was frightened of me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As a result, I spent ten minutes, a day, a week, or three weeks without being harmed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“But, I had exchanged one set of terrors for another: I could get caught."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When Dad caught us he went wild on us with either belts, wooden clothes hangers, whiffle ball bat, 9-iron golf club, or wooden 2x4 paddle. ("
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He forced Doug to make the paddle.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had to sand and finish it.)
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Child abuse was called discipline in those days.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Because fighting and sharing-the-loot were social activities, I began to play with other kids."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I was attracted to ‘nerds’ because they were rarely verbally violent, and never physically."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But I still couldn’t communicate well because I couldn’t articulate my thoughts.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had difficulty forming sentences.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The ‘nerds’ thought I was an imbecile.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I chose to play with girls who were smart and compassionate.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jill weeps by herself.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I hold her while I continue.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff smiles supportively.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Mom realized I needed help.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She hired a reading tutor for me when I was in fifth grade.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Kitty was a cum laude college student.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was delighted.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But Kitty didn’t have the understanding or patience for my problem.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She laughed uncontrollably at some of my pronunciations.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was humiliated because I admired her and thought she was beautiful.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Gabe laughs.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Everyone rebukes him.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I think Gabe laughed because he identified with me,” I say."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“You’re too kind to him,” the white-haired woman says in a witty
tone."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Sorry, Gabe."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I guess cynicism breeds cynicism.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Mom fired Kitty
after the first session."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A year later my parents shut Doug and me in the same room every Saturday.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They gave each of us a book and a dictionary. (
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"What use a dictionary is to someone who can’t read, I’ll never know.)"

“I don’t know if Doug had my problem or just hated reading."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was losing my telepathy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was afraid of knowing Doug’s thoughts.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He knocked the wind from me when I did.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Several times I fell unconscious thinking I wouldn’t awaken.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That would have been okay with me if a place called “hell” hadn’t existed for me then.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“We couldn’t leave the room until we had each read at least four chapters.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was resourceful enough to hoodwink Mom and Dad.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I chose books they would never read, from the ‘Tarzan’ series."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had seen the Tarzan movies at Saturday matinees.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had learned enough sound bites to tell a little of the story by deduction and imagination.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It worked and I was released from confinement after six Saturdays.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Didn’t Doug ever change, to make a long story short,” Gabe
jests. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You are so rude!”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,a voice spews.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I thought we had out-grown our childhood irritations, but at a family
reunion only nine years ago, when Jeff was thirteen, Doug mashed water-melon in Jeff’s face."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff couldn’t breathe.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Because Doug had always been a good father to his children, I realized it was an extension of his hostility for me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Doug seems to be a likable man to everybody else.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"To maintain compassion and equilibrium, I think of him as a dark angel who helped me face fear and disease head-on, and to reverse and heal them."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I cheated throughout my schooling.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was always terrified of getting caught.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But I didn’t know any other way.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,There was no help to ask for as far as I knew.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had been led to believe that my inferior mind couldn’t be fixed.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff stirs restlessly.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He looks hungry and tense.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I decide to finish and take Jeff home, “Then I married at sixteen and had Jeff at seventeen."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was divorced at nineteen.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"So, a lifetime of toxic medical drugs, pollution in everything, especially diet, and daily traumas made me weak enough to quickly develop cancer from medication, surgery and radiation treatments."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was on my deathbed when I began to read well at age twenty-two.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I literally woke one morning several weeks after my initiation into carrot juice and diets and I could read.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I know it was my change of diet and not coincidence.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It was as if my brain ran on high octane and my new diet supplied it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then I began reversing all the deficiencies that my lifetime of severe stress and poor diet caused.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Jeff and I have to leave.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I will return in a couple of weeks, if you’d

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"At that time I will answer specific questions about
diet.” “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You really have to go already?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Gabe asks sadly.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Everyone is upset that I am leaving except Jeff and me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"We are
exhausted."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But no one else presses us to stay.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I am relieved that they don’t and touched that Gabe did.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I look at Jill and say, “Very few bone marrow transplants are successful without side effects."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,About 2%.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Plus it is frightfully expensive.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If you will stop radiation and chemotherapy, and eat fresh, unfrozen raw bone marrow with organic raw beef, your chances of remission and recovery from leukemia are as high as 96%.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“How did you know I was going to have a marrow transplant?!” “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The
medical profession only has three ways of treating bone cancer."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I can see by the side effects that you already have had two of
them.” “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Can my mother call you?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Sure.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Here’s my card.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Take care.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She gives me a hug. “

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Good-night everybody,” I say."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Good-night, and thank you,” Jeff says and we leave."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Still drugged,
Jeff moves slowly and almost stumbles over his own feet."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I start to help him but I stop myself.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He might feel embarrassed in front of everyone if I treat him as if he can’t walk.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He recovers his balance.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Outside, Jeff says, “You had a rough life."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’m sorry.” “

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I need to tell you something,” Jeff says hesitantly. “"

We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I assume you know something about what happened before the accident.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Stacey and Ralph told me a little.”

Three days later
I stand in the kitchen hand-juicing oranges."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I notice Jeff in bed stirring.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He sits up.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“What are you doing awake at nine o’clock in the morning?!”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jus’ woke up.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Beatriz is in the bathroom.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She’ll be out by the time you get there.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He moves at almost normal speed to the side of the sofa bed and
stands."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He wavers, as if dizzy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He sits back down.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Here.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I hand him a large glass of a mixture of orange juice and
certified raw cream. “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Most people have extremely low blood sugar in the mornings.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That’s why it’s so difficult to awake and do anything.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Stand up too fast with too low blood sugar and you’ll get dizzy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Even black out.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I can hardly believe that you are so much more focused, and moving this fast."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You’ve only been eating steak for three days.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“It’s also that I haven’t taken my medication in four days - since the day before we talked about it three days ago.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“You haven’t?!”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I’m a little scared.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Well, you’ve had five months of fear-conditioning."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I trust you.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Thank you.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,How can you be so sure?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Seventeen years experience.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I’ve taken greater risks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"And I didn’t
know as much as I do now."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"But good instincts and intuition, and common sense got my clients and me through successfully.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Do you always eat the same things day after day?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I go with my cravings and desires for food.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Sometimes I’m into lots of raw bland fruit, like cucumbers, tomatoes, summer squash, corn on the cob, zucchini and fresh peas, and a few vegetables like lettuce, alfalfa sprouts, parsley and young spinach with a few ounces of carrot juice."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I mostly eat head lettuce because that’s the kind my body has a taste for.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I know people say that it isn’t nutritious.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They determine that

We_Want_To_Live.txt,They don’t research unbiasedly.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I trust my body.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I am doing excellently for someone who has been through a lot.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Trusting my body, what it wants and eating those foods raw, has been advantageous for me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"But although my body mainly craves fruit, I try to limit fruit and eat plenty of fat and meat.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“The day of my accident Stacey and I broke up.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was really upset and jealous.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I drank half a fifth of one-hundred-and-one proof Wild Turkey.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Do you have any?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Probably more than you want to hear.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff laughs. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I recommend
that you never use salt."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It irritates nerves and destroys cells.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When you feel anger or rage, do not eat cooked meat and, frequently, eat small amounts of cooked starch with tons of raw fat."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"That recipe takes approximately forty minutes after eating to take effect, so you would be wise to exert extreme self-control and do some physical activity until it does."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In general, eating antibiotic-free and hormone-free fertile raw eggs, raw meat, raw cream and no-salt-added raw cheeses, soothe and calm the body.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I talk to Jeff about nutrition for awhile longer.25

We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I thought you said you were always overweight?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Beatriz asks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I was overweight when I ate cooked foods.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I got slender when I switched to all raw but meatless diets.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"And then, when I bicycled and
lived outdoors the stress was so great that I deteriorated.28 I regularly ate as much as three pounds of nuts daily, six avocados, enormous amounts of fruit and every day I awakened a bit thinner that the previous morning."

pollution and its survival-of- the-fittest attitude."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had seen in the wild that only malnourished animals lived by that rule.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Otherwise, life outdoors was peaceful."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I loved living outdoors.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"But, physically, it was too stressful on a raw meatless diet."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Rather than go back to civilization, I decided to fast myself to death."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"First, I dug in and built a ten-by-ten foot stone house in what I was told was an ancient Indian burial ground."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It was in the foothills of a mountain range twenty miles northwest of Salton Sea, here in
California."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Because the house was sunken, the roof was only four and a half feet
above the ground."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"At night, I jumped onto the flat wood roof with my sleeping bag."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I loved falling asleep while watching the stars.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A coyote woke me one night around midnight.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She made sounds like a laughing crazy person.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She stood fifty feet away.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I could see her because I had night vision.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Night vision is something I had developed while living outdoors.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“After several consecutive nights, I realized she had a purpose in waking me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But what it was I didn’t know.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Another night I sensed a coyote passing in the wash twenty feet behind me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I turned and saw him.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wondered why the laughing one woke me when they could have easily passed me while I slept.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This game went on every night for two weeks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Each night I sensed another coyote, without using my eyes or ears. ("
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I think that that was what they had intended - for me to strengthen my sixth sense.)
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then I turned in the direction where I felt he or she was.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And there was another coyote.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Within two weeks I had sensed each one as he or she passed through the narrow canyon by me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,There were eleven in the pack.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“One unusually warm night it rained lightly.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I slept on the ground inside the house.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My sleeping bag was unzipped and I had one leg sticking out.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was awakened by a cold nose rubbing the side of my bare leg.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It was a coyote.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wasn’t alarmed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The coyote dashed away and up the steep grade of the entrance.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He stood looking down at me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He looked straight into my eyes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He motioned his head as if he were indicating that I should follow.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I thought I must be crazy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But he did it again.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I trailed behind him to the pack.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They all nodded at me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I returned the gesture.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“They leapt, butted and played as they started off into the desert."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I followed behind.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was weak from fasting.

up."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We had gone about a half mile when they caught a whiff of something up wind.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The group quietly separated and made a half circle about two hundred yards wide.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The one that stayed with me, looked me in the eyes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He motioned his head for me to follow.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I did.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“We crept about three hundred yards up wind.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then he sped off to the side zigzagging down wind.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He laughed like a crazy person.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I heard the others start to howl and laugh from afar.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They were approaching like an ever-shrinking half circle toward the lone coyote.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He was making his way toward them.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I ran to see what was happening.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A jack rabbit was caught in the half circle.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It zigzagged and leapt around.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But it was trapped by the encroaching chorus of coyotes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The rabbit stopped, paralyzed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I thought I saw an apparition leave the rabbit.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It seemed to no longer have a consciousness.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“A female coyote took the stiff rabbit and broke its neck.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It dangled from her teeth.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Another coyote bit into the skin between the rabbit’s front legs and ripped open its entire torso.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She brought the rabbit to me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She dropped it on my bare feet.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The rabbit was hot and bleeding.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I felt sick.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“All eleven of them stood staring at me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I kept getting this thought: It’s what you need, take and eat it."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They seemed to be sending me that thought.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I flashed back to my childhood.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I remembered the way my brother Doug sent me his thoughts.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"This was the same, but this thought had a gentle feeling about it."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The coyotes were communicating with me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I looked down at the rabbit.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It was warm and moist as if it were alive.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I looked at the coyotes and said, ‘I don’t know, guys, I haven’t eaten meat in six years.’"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then the idea came to me that these coyotes were here to help me quickly end my life.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"A fast could take months (another oxymoron, I thought)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I picked it up.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I took a bite.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I forced myself to swallow.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It came right back up.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The coyotes looked at each other as if it were a joke.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I sat down for five minutes and psyched myself into eating it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After five bites, it tasted delicious."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ate about three and a half pounds.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The coyotes shared what was left: the hind, head, skin and bones."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“They went on food-shopping and I walked back to my rock house to die.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"With every minute that passed, I felt lighter."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I thought that the

poisons were taking effect."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I got my sleeping bag and laid down on the roof.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I felt a
peacefulness that I had only felt during my death experience on the heater with the fresh pizza stains on my shirt."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was sure I was about to leave my body again.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I fell asleep.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I woke the next morning after the best sleep of my life.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The raw rabbit meat made me strong for three more days.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And so I became a raw meat eater.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had found the missing link to my health!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I killed and ate rattle snakes and birds.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I traded my hard labor on farms for eggs, chickens and raw goats’ milk."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My muscles developed easily.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Would you like to go bowling?”

bowling ball and moves into position."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He inserts his right hand fingers into the ball.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He hesitates and flexes his right wrist.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He brings the ball into position.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He makes his approach, slides and brings the ball forward."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He drops it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It bounces hard down the lane and into the gutter.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff looks frustrated and disheartened.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“You expected a strike on your first bowl?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I ask.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Crazy, huh?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He steps back and waits for the ball to return. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Dad, I think that health has a lot to do with your state of mind."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,If you think about good health you make it happen.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“To what extent?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Whatever.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“If you are saying that, because I desired good health and focused on
it, found the means to achieve it and acted on it with successful results, I’ll buy that as a general statement."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"But if you are saying that I didn’t have to do anything other than think about, desire and pray for good health to find myself miraculously healthy one day, you’re talking mind over matter, and I don’t buy it."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I mean, you can take your body for granted like any male chauvinist dominates a woman."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The body will respond.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"But there will always be dire emotional, psychological and physical side effects.”"

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"And why, once you started eating the raw diet and stopped taking the Dilantin, did you begin healing after nearly four and a half months of limbo?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Your state of mind was that you were afraid you would have a seizure.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Why didn’t you have a seizure? (
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Don’t answer yet.)

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I lived in a yoga ashram for two months, once."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"One of the most disciplined young men I had ever met, Sadashiva, was in charge of the Los Angeles community for Sri Vishnu Devananda."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He had been celibate all of his young life.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He had witnessed Vishnu Devananda levitate, that is, float up and remain suspended or bounce in mid air."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But what good was that talent when Vishnu Devananda couldn’t come into agreement with his body?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He witnessed Devananda’s cravings for pizza, canned pineapple, salt and ice cream."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Every time Devananda ate any of them, he got either immobilizing stomach aches, flatulence or headaches."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He ignored that Devananda’s mind-over-matter concept, taught to him as spiritual fact, was not working there."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Anyway, Sadashiva was completely sold on mind-over-matter."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was explaining to him that diet could alter a person’s state of mind as easily as a person’s mind could alter the physical being.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He said that that was completely opposed to everything he had studied in metaphysics, short of poison."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I decided to prove it to him, and myself, without telling him."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I was the dietitian at the vegetarian ashram of which Sadashiva was in charge.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was responsible for selecting and buying food for the entire community.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I chose a food combination that acts as an aphrodisiac.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Sexual pleasure was the absolute no-no there.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Except at dinner, most people ate on the fly, grabbing whatever fruit was available."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had observed that most raw-food fruitarians and vegetarians were often hungry.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Only a handful assimilate enough protein to satisfy the body’s needs.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,At the ashram we were no different.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If delicious food were available, we ate often."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I bought cases of oranges and avocados.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Everyone ate the combination on the fly several times a day.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Within five days, Sadashiva and the other Hatha yoga instructors, excluding me, began talking about the anatomy of their female students."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As the days went on, they became randy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Some started to touch the students - not in lewd ways but unconsciously sensual.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I stopped feeding them oranges and avocados.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Within five days everyone was back to normal.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I told my friend Monica about the experiment. (
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Monica and I had been lovers, but by this time our relationship hadn’t been sexual for about a year.)"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She didn’t know whether to believe me or not.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It seemed so far-fetched.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We decided to repeat the experiment and she would be witness.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I supplied the kitchen with avocados and oranges again.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Within five days they started talking about anatomy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Within eight days, the touching began."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I mentioned to everyone that they were getting awfully randy (without mentioning the food) and shouldn’t they be careful.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They said I had a few screws loose, that they were just playing around, and nothing was going to make them lose control."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Although I wanted to prove to them that their mind-over-matter concept was flimsy in reality, my conscience persuaded me to stop."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I bought pears and apples for them to eat with the avocados instead.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Everyone settled.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Monica and I debated about the results.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Among other things, she said it could have been the full moon that stimulated everyone."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I agreed that that was a probability.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I let a week go by.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I supplied avocados and oranges again.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"By the fourth day, the conversation was wild."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Touching began.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I considered ending the experiment.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Monica agreed that things were getting heated but she argued against my belief that food would drive these ascetics from celibacy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They continued eating avocados and oranges.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“On the sixth day, one of the instructors shared passion with a woman

We_Want_To_Live.txt,They shared intimacy through most of the night.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“So much for mind over matter, or should I say, life in chaos."

vegetarians."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Since then, I discovered that watermelon and avocados together stimulate me more."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Add raw fish, especially raw oysters to that and I don’t have to wait a day or two for it to work."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But the body acclimates to almost anything.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,So I found that an aphrodisiac works for only so long.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“This conversation is making me lose concentration,” Beatriz says, laughing."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Me too,” Jeff says as he takes his bowling stance again."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“God, wasn’t everybody fat from eating all those avocados?!”"

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If a mother isn’t eating a healthy diet or can’t breast-feed for one
reason or another, feeding an infant fresh raw (not heated above 96°) cow’s or goat’s milk will most often resolve colic and make her baby healthy and strong."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But there are some babies (and people) who can’t even digest raw milk properly for several months.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Two ounces of unheated honey and 4 tablespoons of unsalted raw butter blended with a half gallon of raw milk will make the milk digestible.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Three years ago a young Korean couple came to Owanza and me (Owanza is a friend and nutritional colleague who was at one time my nutritional client).
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The distressed mother held her five-month-old infant who screamed just as Jeff had.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Owanza and I could see the couple’s humiliation.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It seemed to me that their gestures at soothing the baby were to show us that they cared and were helpless.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,The mother sighed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Does she cry like that often?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I asked.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,The baby grabbed the bottle and sucked.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Within three seconds she pushed it out, screaming."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The mother looked more discouraged.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The father sighed, disgusted."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Then, in an instant, the baby’s eyes widened."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She grabbed the bottle and nursed it dry within four minutes.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Commercially available unpasteurized raw fresh dairy products are
outlawed in most states except California."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Every state health department is administered by medical doctors.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,All doctors are taught to fear raw dairy - afraid that it is a carrier and cause of disease.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Although there have been thousands of testimonials for the healthy benefits of raw dairy and there has not been one case of disease or illness as a result of certified raw dairy in California, California health officials still try regularly to outlaw raw dairy and deprive the people."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Their argument rests solely on germ theory.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They recently forced the raw dairy industry to put a warning label on their products.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,These labels scare people away from eating those healthy foods.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Health conscious people who are fully aware of the benefits of raw dairy in California have had to fight hard and long over the years to maintain their right of choice. “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Health” officials allow people the choice of cigarettes and alcohol which have been proved harmful, why not allow us the healthful choice of fresh raw dairy?"

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Medical science removes cells from the natural environment of the
body and isolates them in “controlled” environments, like test tubes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It administers chemicals to these isolated cells and observes the reactions.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It treats cells as if they were machines that have no intelligence and that repeat exactly the same movements and functions.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Medical science says that this is the only way experiments can be valid.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But it fails to see that cells do not behave or react the same in “controlled” environments as they do in the body.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Therefore, it can never predict how a person will react to a drug."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,And every body reacts differently.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I have employed a very different approach to experiments.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I see that the body is its own ecological system.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Every body part, gland, cell and particle of blood makes the body the magnificent creature that it is."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eliminate any organ, appendage, hormone or cup of blood, and the body loses a function and/or precise ability."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My approach is wholistic.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,All of my experiments have been employed on the whole person and whole body with food as agent.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"There are always side effects with drugs - sometimes seemingly minor, other times disastrous."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A side effect with raw food is extremely rare.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"To prove that medication prevents healing, I employed research methods formulated by Owanza."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I repeated the following experiments with seven individuals.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,1) I had a blood analysis performed on each person before and after his or her doctor administered a drug (seven different drugs).
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The analyses were specifically focused upon RNA and DNA.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Blood analyses were done twelve hours after drugs were taken.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Mutations were found in the RNA and DNA when compared to the RNA and DNA of the blood taken before drugs were administered.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"2) I also had a urinalysis performed on each person before and after a drug had been administered, specifically focusing on bacteria."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,In all cases the analyses taken before drugs were administered showed a normal live bacterial count.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In all cases the analyses performed 1⁄2 hour after

130 Volume One W E W A N T T O L I V E ! -"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"T H E P R I M A L DIET
taking drugs showed large quantities of dead bacteria."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The next step was to show a correlation between greater bacterial levels and healing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Bacteria, like bears and flies, go in and out of hibernation."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,When conditions are right they wake from hibernation.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Are bears and flies contagious?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Bacteria consume particular damaged, decaying and dead cells when weather, other environmental conditions and bodily cycles are right, and when an individual’s body is ready to detoxify."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"To prove that higher bacterial levels advance healing, I observed ten subjects, each with three open wounds."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"On each person, I treated one wound with alcohol."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I treated another with the subject’s urine only. (
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Urine contains most of the same constituents as blood, except that it contains very few red blood cells."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The practice of using urine as both a cleansing and healing agent has been employed for thousands of years in Ayurvedic medicine.)
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The third wound on each person was left untreated to heal on its own.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The wounds treated with urine healed about three times faster than the ones treated with alcohol.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The wounds that were untreated healed a little quicker than those treated with alcohol.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Conclusion: Alcohol destroys bacteria and retards healing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A high bacterial level inspires healing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In another experiment, I observed several groups of people who had stomach ulcers."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,One group took either Maalox or antibiotics.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Another group drank his or her own urine.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A third group drank urine and ate a raw diet.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The ulcers in those who ate raw foods and drank urine healed two times faster than those who only drank urine.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The ulcers in those treated with medication grew larger.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I asked those who were taking medication to discontinue medication.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,After one week I observed that their stomach secretions had higher bacterial levels.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Concurrently, I observed that the ulcers had diminished in size and/or were less inflamed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Conclusion: Drugs kill bacteria and retard healing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Bacteria inspires healing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"To explore the phenomenon that infection also inspires healing, I observed a person who was suffering from polio."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When the person was treated with the standard drugs, I noticed that there was a drop in body temperature and a loss of bacteria and virus in the blood."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The urinalysis showed very few poliomyelitis virus in the urine and blood.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,However there was no improvement in the condition or symptoms.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I asked the person to discontinue drug therapy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After three days without drugs, the

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Each smoothie consisted of 2 raw eggs blended with a whole green – unripe - banana.)
We_Want_To_Live.txt,No other food was eaten.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,After this nine-day procedure there was about 50% improvement in the condition and symptoms.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I reexamined the blood and urine.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I found a lot of poliomyelitis virus and bacteria.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,In ten weeks this person healed completely without paralysis.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Conclusion: Drugs destroyed bacteria, prevented cells from manufacturing virus, and interfered with healing processes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When the subject stopped medication and began to eat the right nutrients, bacteria and virus increased and healing began and continued until complete."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Bacteria and virus are necessary for proper cleansing and healing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"To prove that medication stores in the tissues, Owanza suggested that I examine people who had a long history of drug treatment."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I found hard dry areas on their skin.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had small tissue samples cut from these hard dry spots and had them analyzed for chemicals.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Every tissue sample was found to contain small amounts of medical chemicals, specifically those containing alkaloids."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In another test I conducted, I had small tissue samples taken from the throats of people who had long histories of taking drugs such as Emperin, codeine, aspirin, Fiorinal, and other drugs which effect the mucous membranes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had the tissue samples analyzed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,All of the analyses showed trace amounts of drugs.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In another experiment, I worked with subjects who had long histories of taking antibiotics."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I asked them to discontinue taking medication for at least two weeks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then blood and urine samples were taken and specifically analyzed for drugs.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"These samples showed only trace amounts of drugs, or no drugs at all."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I suggested that the subjects follow a diet for six weeks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,First thing in the morning each of them ate 1⁄2 cup raw fatty beef with one tablespoon of unheated honey.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When the stomach growled, indicating hunger, each of them ate 2 fresh oranges and a tablespoon of unheated honey."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Again, after the stomach growled, each of them ate another 1⁄2 cup raw fatty beef with one tablespoon of unheated honey."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They continued to eat the beef and oranges, alternately, throughout each day until they went to sleep for the night."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They always waited until their stomachs growled before eating the beef

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I am reluctant to mention the harm that vaccines produce because
most everyone is adamantly brainwashed that vaccines produce immunity."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, I would be negligent to ignore how vaccines actually affect health."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Allopathic medicine is based on the “germ theory”, that microbes and viruses, cause disease."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Medical science bases the use of vaccines on the theory that the body forms antibodies to “fight” natural viruses.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They believe that these antibodies live on after the virus is contained, thereby creating immunity."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,First we must consider the facts known to evaluate medicine’s viral theory.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Science has proved that virus are not alive, that they are predominantly protein but that they contain organic DNA."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Science has proved that virus increase only in the presence of live cells, and that they cause certain cells, and/or parts of cells to dissolve."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"What is believed and taken as fact but not proved, is that viruses are non- discriminatingly destructive “things” that self-replicate."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"That is like saying that laundry soap, because it is found in homes inhabited by

We_Want_To_Live.txt,That is because some drugs will be dumped into the stomach and be arrested there.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eating during the dump/arrest phase, or mixing the beef and oranges in digestion - by eating either before the other has completely been digested - causes indigestion, increases nausea, and sometimes causes vomiting. ("

humans, self-replicates."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Those assumption and conclusion are shallow and ludicrous.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Medical science operates from fear, and it attacks the body."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,All medical procedures for treating disease are written by pharmaceutical-related individuals and groups.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That is a severe conflict of interest.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Self-produced health or medication-dependent profit, which do you think that they want?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"A rational and logical conclusion would be that virus are solvents (cleansers) manufactured by individual cells to dissolve degenerative tissue (disease) caused by accumulated waste and industrial toxins, including medicines."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Virus contain DNA because cells have used substances within themselves to synthesize virus; DNA is a part of that.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When the cleansing and healing processes cease, cells stop producing large amounts of virus."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Normally, healthier bodies symbiotically utilize bacteria and parasites to cleanse themselves of cellular degenerative tissue and organic waste."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They are the bodies preferred janitors.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Bacteria and parasites consume the degenerative tissue and organic waste and reduce it to a tiny fraction of the original mass eaten.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They can consume 100 times their weight and reduce it to 1-percent excretion.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When eating a healthy raw diet, our bodies easily secrete and/or excrete the 1-percent excretions from bacteria and parasites."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, when bodies become too toxic with industrial toxins, including medicines, the bacteria and parasites are poisoned to death."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Under such toxic conditions, the only cleansing method that the body can utilize is virus."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"So, cells synthesize viruses."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I reiterate, viruses are solvents that dissolve degenerative tissue and organic waste."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They are beneficial in preventing disease; they do not cause disease.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The symptoms that accompany viral, bacterial or parasitical detoxifications are a necessary process but can be mitigated with the consumption of plenty of raw eggs and raw dairy fats."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The key is: We should trust, nurture and understand the body and Nature, not fear them."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Microbes do not cause disease.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Regarding the immediate trauma that vaccines cause in many people, the eminent scientist and physician, Dr. William F. Koch, M.D., Ph.D. said:
The injection of any serum, vaccine or even penicillin has shown a very marked increase in the incidence of polio - at least 400%."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Statistics are so conclusive no one can deny it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The long term effects of vaccines are just as harmful.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Vaccines are made of disease, mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde and other poisonous chemicals."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Pharmaceutical houses manufacture diseases in animal tissue.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The diseases are sterilized to make vaccines.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Sterilization alters the RNA, DNA, structure and actions of diseases and viruses."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When a sterilized disease or virus enters the body, the body tries to analyze it and create antibodies to regulate the disease or virus."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The body cannot find the logical reason for the unnatural disease or virus.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Nor can it find the key to the time that the bacteria or virus will be active.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Therefore the body creates mutant antibodies that do not go dormant for up to decades.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,These mutant antibodies remain active long after the disease or virus becomes inactive.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The mutant antibodies eat sub-particles from the
inside of amino acids (proteins) in the blood.31 That renders proteins unstable."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The amount of proteins damaged and lost to mutant
antibodies depends on the number of vaccines."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Because amino acids are the primary building blocks of cells, the consequence is cellular malnutrition."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In all animals, the malnutrition causes gradual genetic mutations, resulting in weaknesses, diseases, malfunctions and deformities."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Dad probably recalls his childhood and thinks how much easier my childhood was compared to his.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But Dad wasn’t sick or injured six months out of every year as I was.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Although, I do remember a story he told me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When Dad was three years old, he was walking in the barnyard and a Clydesdale horse kicked him in the face and put him in a coma."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Everybody thought Dad would die.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Nearly every year as a child thereafter Dad got severe migraines with an infection under his cheekbone.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The doctor literally hammered a horseshoe nail through Dad’s skin and cheekbone to drain the infection.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,No anesthetic was used.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Dad’s migraines continued through the years.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I believe Dad’s trauma never healed because his nerves didn’t properly heal.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He didn’t eat raw meat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"And he ate a lot of salt, which causes high blood pressure in the brain (the main reason for
headaches33)."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,I worked with people who had long histories of headaches.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Ninety
percent of these people ate a lot of salt."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When they stopped consuming all types of condiment salts (which are radical, that is, harmful), including sea salt, they stopped having frequent headaches."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Periodically their headaches returned.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Whenever the headaches returned, I had their blood and urine analyzed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Each analysis showed sodium molecules clumping - just as if they had recently consumed condiment salts.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They assured me they hadn’t.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Also, all of the analyses showed high levels of dead cells, especially liver and brain cells."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The conclusion I drew was that radical salts had stored in the body and killed the surrounding cells by dehydrating them.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I realized that the salt and dead cells in the blood and urine indicated that the body was cleansing salt and dead cells.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"And that salts store throughout the body, especially in the brain and sometimes liver and brain."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"All nutrients - proteins, starches, sugars, vitamins, minerals, enzymes

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Each requires all of the other nutrients in varying amounts to be properly utilized.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"All supplements lack most of the balancing nutrients, especially bioactive enzymes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If all are not present, the body leaches nutrients from its own supply (if it can afford to)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Supplements create a balance/depletion see-saw effect.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I experimented with supplements for two years.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I started this research while I was the nutritionist at a health food store.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Of the 1,200 supplements we carried, I observed that only nine had any significant benefits."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Those nine supplements were all prepared at temperatures below 82° Fahrenheit and were not chemically treated or extracted.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Over those two years, I observed that the remaining 1,191 supplements created toxicity throughout people’s bodies, especially

OUT OF THE GRIPS OF DISEASE AND DEATH 141
their glandular systems."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"For example, many people who regularly consumed iron supplements
had iron deposits somewhere in their systems."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The worst deposits appeared as rust spots in Iridology.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Almost all mega-dose-Vitamin C- takers suffered irritability, psychological problems and frequent hunger - sometimes compulsive - for ice cream, chocolate and/or other rich foods."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"This is because supplemental Vitamin C is spiky, like glass, irritating blood and nerve cells."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It depletes fat from the blood and makes the blood highly acidic.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,People often reported an increase in energy from taking supplements but I observed that the increase in energy was most often a toxic effect.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The toxicity forced certain hormones to rush into the system, similar to caffeine or nicotine rushes that ultimately have damaging effects on the entire body."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Unless supplements are prepared correctly, the side effects outweigh the benefits."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"By the time I left supplement research, 6 of the 9 beneficial supplements had been destroyed: wheat germ oil, 2 brands of cod liver oil, shark oil and 2 brands of primary yeast powders."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The pharmaceutical houses and the American Medical Association created a myth that synthetic, natural and organic were all the same; so why pay more?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The media circulated the myth.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Manufacturers altered their processing to compete in the cheaper markets.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Most often, depression is caused by too much carbohydrate sugar and sugar byproducts in the blood, lymph and nerves."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Carbohydrates made into blood sugar result, unfavorably, in high sugar byproducts, causing the blood, lymph and nerve serums to be sticky, causing reduced bodily functions and hypoglycemia."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Naturally, when too much carbohydrate sugar enters the blood, the pancreas produces insulin."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When mutant sugars enter the blood, the pancreas overproduces insulin even if the blood sugar is low."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Refined sugars are mutations, including flash pasteurized products."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They enter the blood too fast.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When refined sugars are eaten, the body first tries to turn them into a more natural sugar."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, most of the sugar just passes into the blood as mutations."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They over-stimulate the liver and pancreas.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eventually, bile and hormones, like insulin, bind with the sugars and leave the blood low in sugar (hypoglycemia)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Over a period of time, this can lead to the eventual exhaustion of the pancreas (diabetes)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Although it would take considerably longer, the same can result from eating too much raw fresh fruit and fruit juices."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The best way to resolve the blood-sugar problems that cause depression is to eat a lot of raw meat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When the body forms blood sugars from meat, the blood sugar is called pyruvate."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The body’s use of pyruvate results, favorably, in low sugar byproducts allowing clean body serums, including in the nerves."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"For some people, simply changing to a raw diet, that includes lots of raw meat, relieves depression."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"For a few, adding only raw fats to their diet is the simple answer because without proper fat, proteins cannot be assimilated for many purposes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eating raw meat with raw fat, and reducing fruit intake to once daily in the afternoon only, feeds the liver and pancreas, regenerates and rebuilds them and, over a period of many years, repairs them to where they cease to automatically over-dump sugar into the blood and over-produce insulin."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Another cause of chronic depression is too-low of bacterial levels throughout the body.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When high levels of bacteria are present, proper detoxification occurs."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Bacteria are janitors who consume organic cellular waste, keeping the body clean."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When the body is low in bacterial levels, the body becomes overloaded with organic waste and toxins, causing cellular depression that is experienced throughout the body and mind, and expressed emotionally."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The low-bacterial cause of depression can be alleviated by eating stinky bacterially decomposing meat, as several cultures do, such as the Eskimo."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The Eskimo call that meat “high” meat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eating an ounce of high meat usually relieves depression in 10-20 minutes and may last for weeks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I demonstrated that there is no danger from eating meat with enormous amounts of bacteria on Ripley’s Believe It Or Not (it first

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The recipe to make high meat is in my recipe book, The Recipe For Living Free of Disease."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"A less favorable way to keep the blood sugar level balanced is to eat one cooked starch (like French bread, rice cakes, pasta, air-popped corn, baked or steamed potato) with lots of raw fat (like avocado, unsalted raw butter, no-salt-added raw cheese, raw cream, raw eggs, stone-pressed olive oil or fresh coconut) with a little fresh fruit."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"For people with severely overactive pancreases, that combination - in small amounts - may have to be consumed two to four times daily."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, the cooked starch always results in accumulations of sugar byproducts and toxins."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,How the last recommendation works is that the cooked starch easily binds with excess insulin.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Then the raw fat binds with the starch-insulin
mass and escorts it to the bowels.34 The fresh fruit raises the blood sugar level to normal."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Depression is gone or mitigated within forty
minutes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, many sugar byproducts and other toxins from the cooked starch accumulate in the body and could eventually cause disease."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It’s hungriest water that starts leaching nutrients from the digestive tract and blood, then from the rest of the body."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,All water disturbs the balance of the digestive juices and intestinal flora.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,“She craves salt!

We_Want_To_Live.txt,“It causes sodium molecules to clump in the blood.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That reverses ion magnetism and pulls the guts (so to speak) from cells.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The affected cells can no longer eat anything and they shrivel and die.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Four little bitty grains of salt - including sea salt - destroy approximately two million red blood cells.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It takes at least three hours to replace the blood cells and about 24 hours to cleanse the dead cells.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,During those processes important nutrients are leached from the blood and body.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As a result, salt speeds aging."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“The craving for salt is symptomatic of a mineral deficiency.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Beatriz asks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“No.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,At that time I didn’t believe raw beef was healthy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A friend and I had had a very bad experience with raw liver and sweet breads - that weren’t organically grown.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She vomited and I had terrible hallucinations.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It wasn’t until after my poisonous mushroom experience that I discovered that animals store most of their toxins in glands and bones.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"That’s when I realized that it was okay to eat muscle meat of non-organically grown beef, but not the glands."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It was almost a year after the poison mushroom before I ate raw red meat.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"____ Appendix P
(From Appendix O, page 145.)"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,There are three basic blood types when determining what meat someone should eat regularly.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,These types are: 1) People who naturally have acidic blood easily produce red blood cells.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They do not naturally produce enough white blood cells.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Generally, this type should eat mostly white raw meat (fish, fowl, rabbit) to be balanced."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If they eat red meat more than occasionally they will have a tendency to be irritable, impatient, overanxious and overaggressive."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,2) People who naturally have alkaline blood easily produce white blood cells.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They do not naturally produce enough red blood cells.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Generally, this type should eat mostly red raw meat (beef, lamb, venison) to be balanced."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,If they eat white meat more than occasionally they will have a tendency to be lethargic and tired (anemic) 3) People who naturally have a balanced blood pH produce a balance of red and white blood cells.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Generally, this type should eat both red and white raw meat to remain balanced."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Few of this type can do fairly well as vegetarians.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Type 1 usually has a ruddier complexion, holds a tan easily, and/or has a high adrenaline level (that is, they have a lot of physical energy)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Type 2 usually has a light complexion, his or her tan fades moderately to quickly, and/or he or she is more emotionally and mentally oriented
35 SeeAppendixP,above."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"OUT OF THE GRIPS OF DISEASE AND DEATH 151
than physically oriented."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Type 3 normally has a balanced complexion, tanning cycle, and a near-even balance of physical, emotional and mental energies."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A person can change from one of these blood types to either of the other types many times throughout his or her lifetime.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"____ Appendix Q
(Part of the conversation cut from page 96.)"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Byron, a nutritional client and friend, got a call from the Health Department one day last year."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They told him that a woman with whom he had had an intense sexual relationship for three months was in second stage syphilis.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He called me immediately, horrified:
“Byron,” I said, “in order for syphilis to flourish in your body, you would have to have acute toxicity in your nervous system."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You have been on a raw diet for years, so you’re clean enough of toxins."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Go down to the clinic and have the test, but I suggest you do not take medication."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It is meant to poison the virus but viruses are not alive and cannot be poisoned.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“But Aajonus, this is syphilis,” Byron shouted."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Go get the test done and then you will know.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"About a half hour later, Byron called again."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He was at the clinic.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Everyone here is panicked because I refused the medication.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They say that no one is immune to syphilis and that it could already be in my brain because the woman is in advanced second stage.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Aajonus, I’m going to take the medication."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,What should I do to counteract the side effects?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“The medication is a poison.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Just buy billions of cell caskets and kiss your energy and sexuality good-bye, because they will diminish for years to come - pardon the pun.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Aajonus, don’t kid around, this is serious.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Something has to make you rational again.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Take a look at who’s promoting the fear and who’s profiting.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Trust me, you do not have syphilis."

conjunction with your raw diet keeps you clean and healthy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Use your common sense.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Panic persuades people to do all sorts of things that are not beneficial.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Who in their right mind is going to drink poison because someone tells them to?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"One or two more days isn’t going to melt your brain, Byron.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Aajonus!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This is syphilis.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I have said all I can.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It is your body, your life and you have to live it."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It is your choice.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Okay.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Thanks. ‘
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Bye.’ ”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Five minutes later, Byron called again, “Aajonus, they say I have to take the medication."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Would you tell me it’s syphilis one more time, just to make sure I remember?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Will you stop joking around?!
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We’re talking about my brain and nervous system.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Byron, right now we’re talking panic and fear."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I told you the choice is yours.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They cannot make you take the medication.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It has dangerous side effects.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He handed the phone to the man at the clinic, and the man said, “Excuse me, how can you be human and put this man’s life at more risk?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Don’t you care about him, or is he just a client you take money from?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I mean, get rational, sir, this is serious."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This is syphilis.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Now, now, be nice, and calm down."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,How long will it take to get the results?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I asked.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“As early as tomorrow, if we rush it through."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But he has to begin the medication now.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Would you read the specific law stating that he has to take medication, and the procedures to enforce it.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“It could take weeks to go through the procedures,” he said."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“Exactly, so until a judge would rule that he would have to take it, he does not have to take it."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"And for a judge to order that, a syphilis- positive blood result would be required."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Am I right?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“You have no idea the danger you are putting your client in.” “
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Let me ask you this, does the medication have side effects?” “"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Of course.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“If Byron’s test comes back negative for syphilis, would you be

We_Want_To_Live.txt,“This is crazy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This is syphilis.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Your ignorance is really sad.”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I have been exposed to the medical profession my entire life, so
ignorant regarding it, I am not."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I have also been experimenting with raw food diets for 151⁄2 years, so ignorant about that I am not."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Have you ever experienced anyone on a raw diet like Byron’s who tested positive?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I asked.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I’m not aware of anyone exposed to syphilis who was on a raw diet.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Have you worked with syphilis like I have?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I admit ignorance to your experience, but not about syphilis."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Since you are absolutely certain, would you be willing to pay one thousand dollars in damages if Byron does not have syphilis as a disease or as a carrier?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“You are crazier than I thought,” he said and hung up."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Byron did not take the medication and the test results were negative.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They demanded he take the test again.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He did.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It was also negative.”

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“If a medicine gets a 20% effectual rate, it’s considered worthy."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Back to your question about eating the same thing day after day.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I eat meat almost every day, but which meat I eat changes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Once, for sixteen months, I craved only raw organic chicken."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I couldn’t eat any other meat, except fish several times a month."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Another time, for six months, the only meat I could eat was lamb."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"One year I craved meat two to three times daily, eating as much as four pounds a day."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Another year I could only eat about one third of a pound once daily.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Other times I had to eat parsley and fish with beef because beef alone made me too acidic and I got sores around my mouth.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I just stay in touch with my
body’s taste and needs.”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“Do you think raw foods would work for everybody?”
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Jeff asks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“I don’t know if the few hundred people I’ve counseled who have
actually done it are enough proof that my approach could help everyone, but it’s the most effective diet for developing and maintaining health that I know."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Everyone’s body is different and everyone will eat differently, but basically we were raw-food eaters for millions of years before cooking became convenient and changed our sense of taste."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,“I’ve seen that most people are ill because they don’t digest cooked or processed foods well enough.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Not many of us have mutated to handle cooked foods to create or even maintain health without disease.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“But everybody has to follow their own instincts, that is, whatever they have a taste for."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Generally, I suggest that whatever it is one craves, he or she should eat it raw."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Most often I’ve found that foods artificially

heated above 104° Fahrenheit are inferior for creating and maintaining optimal health."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Very few people who have eaten a cooked-and- processed-food diet lived without any health complication throughout a long lifetime.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“If people are satisfied with their health, then my view isn’t for them."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If they are not, as I was not, I suggest they cultivate a taste for raw food."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“If, for example, you like sauces, discover what is in them, buy the raw ingredients and mix or blend and eat them raw."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Pay attention to whether you digest them well.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If you have problems or discomfort, simplify the ingredients."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Experiment until both your taste buds and digestive system are satisfied.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"“A few rules of thumb, but not absolutes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If you are feeling shaky, it most often indicates too low of a blood protein level."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eat whatever raw meat appeals to you (no-salt-added raw cheeses - a fat that is high in concentrated minerals - will also help this symptom but not as effectively).
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If you are feeling depressed, it’s most often low blood sugar."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eat some fresh fruit with raw fat and a cooked starch.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If you are feeling hyperactive, anxious, impatient, or irritable, it indicates one of two things: either you are overproducing adrenaline and/or other stimulants, or your blood fat level is so low the body’s own acids irritate the nerves."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eat cooked starch with lots of raw fat and/or raw meat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If you are feeling headachy, nauseous or just have no appetite, it most often indicates that your blood is over acidic and/or toxic."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eat some no-salt-added raw cheese and drink some fresh-squeezed lemon or lime juice with some unheated honey and naturally carbonated water.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Sometimes a salad or fresh raw vegetable juice is also helpful.

INTRODUCTION
The Raw Truth
by Rob Strauds
As a researcher and practitioner of the healing arts I have devoted a great deal of time and energy to the study and application of what is variously referred to as “alternative”, “holistic” or “natural” healing, which embody most of the “modalities” currently in use."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After many years I concluded that while the “alternative” approaches to illness and health are generally more organic in principle than conventional drug- based allopathic medicine, many of them still treat symptoms rather than whole organisms."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They often merely substitute herbs, supplements and other substances for drugs."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It became apparent to me that neither medical science nor alternative medicine was going to resolve the issues of degenerative illness, radiant health, and longevity, in the laboratory."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The number of variables and the vast complexity of biological and subtle energy processes and reactions in the miraculous human “body-mind” seem to defy any attempt by man or machine to ultimately “figure it out” at the biochemical level.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Intelligent and talented men and women have devoted decades of their lives to researching tiny fragments of human biochemistry and still their conclusions are often contradictory, incompatible with one another, wrong, or limited in their healing applications."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Although there have been remarkable advances in medical science, the foundational understandings necessary to resolve degenerative disease and produce radiant health and significant longevity are still not evident."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In the field of natural healing in the Twentieth century, the work of pioneers such as Bernard Jensen, Paul Bragg, Paavo Airola, and others, has led to a greater understanding of the single most fundamental principle of health and healing."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"These landmark health practitioners embraced food for detoxification, regeneration and rejuvenation."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The human body is, after all, a “food body”, and although there are emotional, psychological and spiritual components to health, any system that does not incorporate food as a primary healing therapy is seriously negligent."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My investigation, therefore, led me to the confusing and contradictory world of diet and nutrition: vegetarianism, dairy-free veganism, macrobiotics, Chinese dietary therapy, raw foods, etc."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In the course of studying and experimenting with each approach, a significant

166 Volume Two W E W A N T T O L I V E ! -"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"T H E P R I M A L DIET
factor seemed to emerge (based on successful results): the health of living organisms is dependent on the use of live, organic food in raw form, rich in enzymes and other nutrients that have not been destroyed or reduced by heat or other processing."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Consequently, I pursued the work of Ann Wigmore, Victor Kulvinskas and other advocates of vegetarian raw-foodism."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,As time passed I observed that the completely raw vegetarian diet was not for everyone.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"While some benefited, many tended to become weakened by it."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Some could not easily digest raw vegetables, even with enzyme supplementation, making it difficult or impossible for them to eat salads."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,In one instance I observed a rapid decline in the health of a cancer patient (who had been improving somewhat on a modified macrobiotic diet) when he switched to an all-raw diet.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Doubts surfaced.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The questions kept arising: Is there a fundamental dietary approach to prevention, healing, and longevity?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If so, on what basis would that diet vary from one individual to another?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I decided to approach the matter in a different way; to start from the desired result and work backwards.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"This took two forms, 1) to seek and research the work of health practitioners who were consistently (75- 90%) reversing deep-seated pathology (cancer, AIDS, chronic fatigue syndrome, etc.)"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"and evaluate and compare their methods, 2) to study the diets and lifestyles of cultural groups that enjoyed radiant health and significant longevity and look for commonalities."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In phase one, I found that such practitioners were hard to come by, for several reasons: a) they often work alone rather than in the context of a larger organization or clinic, b) they are generally not mainstream or even well known, and c) they generally maintain low profiles because of the political and economic dangers of curing diseases in a society controlled and policed by medical and scientific prejudices."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I began to hear about the work of Aajonus Vonderplanitz, a practitioner who had apparently facilitated 232 cancer remissions (of 240 cases) as well as many recoveries from heart disease, chronic fatigue and other serious illnesses."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Even more remarkable was the fact that these healings were effected almost exclusively through diet.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I contacted him immediately and ordered the manuscript The Primal Diet; We Want To Live.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The book was a revelation.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The first reading left me astonished.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After months of enjoying significant health improvements from the diet, I found myself involved in a week-long face-to-face apprentice- ship with its creator."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I was pleasantly surprised at my first encounter.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"INTRODUCTION 167
His general appearance was that of a man ten years younger; his skin and hair possessed the healthful glow that develops from the inside rather than from the mere use of topical cosmetic products; his musculature exhibited a tone that results from regular work-outs, despite the fact he had not done any significant exercise in seventeen years."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The most amazing characteristic was the clarity of his eyes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Iridologists will tell you how very rare it is to find a human being alive in today’s toxic world, whose irises show little or no signs of disease or toxicity."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,An examination of his irises revealed a complete circle of solid blue filaments radiating outward from the pupils.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"There were none of the yellow, green, brown, white or dark discolorations and telltale shapes that appear in most eyes and reveal states of less than optimal health."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The man was a living testimony to the validity of his work.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"His dietary approach postulates two fundamental principles: 1) food of any kind is best eaten in its live, raw condition, rich in enzymes and other nutrients, and 2) a diet resplendent in raw fats and raw meats taken from natural sources is essential to excellent health."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The latter may be hard for us to grasp since we live in a fat-phobic, meat-phobic, and bacteria-phobic society, where fats, meats and bacteria are blamed for just about everything short of the depletion of the ozone layer."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When we speak of raw fat and raw meat, we must think of them as new food groups, utterly different in their biochemistry from the fats and meats we have been taught to avoid in cooked form."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The diet primarily encompasses: a) raw animal meats (beef, fish, poultry, organic eggs), b) raw dairy products (unsalted raw butter, raw milk, raw cream, unsalted raw cheeses, raw kefir), c) raw whole fruits and vegetables (especially vegetable juices), d) unheated honey."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Traditional Precedents
The idea of consuming raw meats and raw dairy products in raw diets has many historical precedents."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Much of this history was brought to light by two pioneering doctors who researched the subject extensively in the first half of the Twentieth century.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Francis Pottenger, Jr., M.D., was a physician and researcher who demonstrated that raw foods contain unique nutrients vital to health."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,His research included a now- classic series of controlled experiments that involved more than nine hundred cats for more than ten years.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Pottenger proved that raw foods (including raw milk and raw meat) were required to maintain these

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"T H E P R I M A L DIET
animals in excellent health."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He applied elements of this knowledge to the care of his patients with tuberculosis and other chronic diseases, with excellent and well-documented results."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Unfortunately, while his work was initially well received by the medical profession, it has been ignored in the ensuing years."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Weston Price, D.D.S., was a contemporary of Pottenger who, during his years in practice, began noticing in the children of his patients problems which their parents had not experienced."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Besides having more decay, in many children the teeth did not fit properly into the dental arch, causing them to be crowded and crooked."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He noticed also that the condition of deformed teeth reflected the overall state of compromised health.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Considering possible reasons, the idea occurred to him that perhaps there was some deficiency in modern diets."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"While others in his profession looked for causative factors in dental decay, Price searched among primitive people for one or more nutritional factors protecting them."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,His travels took him to the corners of the earth.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He and his wife lived with and studied Swiss people in high Alpine valleys; Gaels on islands of the Outer Hebrides; Eskimos in Alaska; Indians in the far northern, western and central parts of Canada and western United States and Florida; Melanesians and Polynesians in the South Pacific; Africans in eastern and central Africa; Aborigines in Australia; Malay tribes on islands north of Australia; Maori in New Zealand; and descendants of ancient civilizations in Peru."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Fortunately, Price traveled and conducted his research during the 1930’s when the cultures he observed were still primarily indigenous, and groups of people still lived entirely on local foods that they mostly ate raw."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He found cultures without tooth decay and children without misshapen dental arches or crowded teeth.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He interviewed an American medical doctor living among Eskimos and northern Native-Americans who reported that in thirty-five years of observation, he had never seen a single case of cancer among natives subsisting on their traditional foods."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When natives eating “civilized” man’s processed foods developed tuberculosis and other diseases, this doctor sent them back to their native villages and foods."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They usually recovered.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In the course of his travels, Price specifically searched for groups that maintained immunity to dental and chronic disease on diets consisting entirely of vegetable matter."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He did not find any.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Every healthy native culture he studied ate many animal foods raw; tradition often dictated which foods.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The milk, cheese and butter of Swiss villagers and

INTRODUCTION 169
African herdsmen were seldom heated."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Animal glands and organs, in every traditional culture, were often eaten raw."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eskimos of Arctic regions, where no plants were available much of the year, ate a lot of raw meat and fish."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This tradition prevented scurvy; the vitamin C in meat and fish is destroyed by cooking.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Islanders in the South Pacific and coastal Australian Aborigines ate most food raw, including shellfish."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As Price’s studies progressed, it emerged ever more clearly that healthy, free-ranging animal life of the land and sea provided humans everywhere with essential nutrients apparently unobtainable in adequate quantities from plants alone."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It is useful and inspiring to study the diets of these indigenous people in order to break through the conditioning and fixed ideas that dictate what we should and shouldn’t eat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"An obvious example is the objection to eggs as a food that contains cholesterol that is dangerous to the heart and arteries, particularly in individuals who already have high cholesterol levels."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The fact is, however, that harmful cholesterol accumulations result from cooked fats; accumulations decrease when raw fats, including raw whole eggs, are eaten."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"To quote Edward Howell in his classic work, Enzyme Nutrition:
...when fats, either animal or vegetable, are eaten along with their associated enzymes, no harmful effect on the arteries or heart results."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,All fatty foods contain lipase in their natural state.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Cooking or processing removes it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"While similar to traditional diets, most of the principles and formulas contained in We Want To Live constitute a unique discovery, one which opens an entirely new healing paradigm."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The work of Aajonus Vonderplanitz, as presented in these two volumes, is truly a pioneering effort which should become a significant breakthrough in the health- care revolution that looms on the horizon."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If we don’t take responsibility and care for our individual health, how can we have more than limited abilities, limited happiness and limited control over our lives?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Understanding Food That Nourishes Us With Radiant Health
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
WHY DOES LIVE FOOD ASSIST HEALING?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We are born with a given supply of nutrients in our bodies to facilitate all bodily functions.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Enzymes, vitamins, minerals, sugars, fats and proteins are just some of the known nutrients."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As we grow, we require greater quantities of all nutrients."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"We eat to supply this need so that we develop fully, healthfully."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Many nutrients are expended during bodily processes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Those nutrients must be replaced.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We eat to supply them and maintain or achieve the most efficient bodily functions and optimal health.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Enzymes are catalysts for every metabolic process from thinking, to smiling, to healing, to cleansing, to cellular regeneration."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Vitamins, minerals, sugars, fats, proteins and all other nutrients cannot be digested, assimilated or utilized properly without a myriad of active enzymes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Raw foods contain a myriad of active enzymes and have plentiful supplies of vitamins and other nutrients.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eating raw foods ensures optimal digestion and functioning, and replaces expended nutrients, promoting excellent health."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"170

DISEASE?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I have found that all sickness is rooted in malnutrition, pollution and the accumulation of toxins."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This includes allergy-related conditions and genetic diseases.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Malnutrition results from a person not getting the nutrients (or combination and balance of nutrients) that his or her body needs.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Disease most often results from a combination of malnutrition and accumulated toxins, or an instant poisoning, such as results from many vaccines and other industrial substances."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Under this heading, the toxins that result from cooking food will be our focus."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Cooking and processing foods destroy nutrients by altering their shape, size and chemistry."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"This causes biochemical confusion, and toxicity in the body (the accumulation of harmful substances, residues, and debris)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Immersing fully charged batteries into boiling acid would cause batteries to lose charge, be destroyed and become debris."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That is analogous to the destruction of nutrients by cooking.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Because nutrients have been destroyed in cooked and processed foods, eating cooked and processed foods forces the body to leach enzymes from its own supply to digest, assimilate and utilize whatever is eaten, breathed and absorbed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Enzymes are not the only nutrients that are leached.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Our bodies leach cells, vitamins, minerals, proteins, and hormones from our constitutions, gradually weakening us."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Leaching increases work that the body and enzymes must do.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Consequently, increasingly, work does not get done."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Gradually, inert and volatile toxins accumulate."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Cells weaken.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Cellular functions decline, causing bodily deterioration and disease."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We call this aging.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Therefore, cooked diets lack what the body needs to more easily build, protect and cleanse itself."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Many people over age 20 easily succumb to gravity and lose muscle tone because they eat cooked and processed foods.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Most people have at least one ailment because they eat cooked and processed foods.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If instinct and intuition were not muddled with traditional dietary habits, and if healthy foods were available, we would eat only for good health and the body would never get to the state of gross toxicity that is disease."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Disease would be a concept rather than a fact.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, while we lack intuitional and instinctual connectedness, symptoms of illness are as necessary to achieving good health as ears are to good hearing."

body that does not manifest symptoms would behave like a little girl who had no feeling of hot or cold."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Sadly, she burned off her backside from her waist to her knees when she sat for five minutes on a hot radiator."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Symptoms are the body’s way of telling us that something needs to change.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,In all cases it is a change in diet that is needed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"But in some cases, other changes may be necessary in conjunction with a dietary change."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Simply avoiding certain foods and environmental pollutants, such as smoke, poisonous fumes and radiation, sometimes corrects an ailment with time."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In others cases, besides a change in diet, physical or psychological changes may be needed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"For instance, leaving a cynical mind-set and becoming more open-minded, accepting and creative."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Or sometimes what is needed is to leave an unhappy or inappropriate or non-improvable relationship.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Sabotaging symptoms with drugs puts a person in greater danger of disease, suffering and early death."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Correcting the causes of illness is the cure.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Adopting a healthy diet and environment naturally lessen and eventually eliminates symptoms, indicating that health gradually improves."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,WHY ARE SOME PEOPLE HEALTHY EVEN THOUGH THEY EAT COOKED AND PROCESSED FOODS?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The body, as a whole and on a cellular level, always strives toward good health."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The changes in shape, size and chemistry of nutrients from cooking forces the body to invent and manufacture unusual forms of enzymes to facilitate all metabolic processes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We will call those ENZYME-MUTATIONS.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Some individuals have a full spectrum of enzyme-mutations, and are better able than others to digest, assimilate, and utilize the mutilated nutrients in cooked and processed foods, as well as discard the enormous waste."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Consequently, those people are healthier than people who do not have a full spectrum of enzyme- mutations."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Each body handles nutrients and toxicity differently.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,There are so few people who do very well on cooked foods that we are genetically an unstable species.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As a whole, mankind has not come close to altering himself to live on cooked and processed foods without

disease."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Diseases are changing form and increasing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They are not being eradicated.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Genetic illness is the same malnutrition carried on for generations; that is, dietary habits are learned and followed from generation to generation."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When a deficiency is continued in a particular family, the genetic plan for proper functioning of one or more body parts or systems is misplaced, but usually not lost, at birth or during the lifetime."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Most genetic illness can be corrected in time if the right nutrients are eaten.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The onslaught of pollution has created a need for more nutrients and enzyme-mutations to neutralize, constrain, and eliminate more toxins."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,WHY ARE SOME PEOPLE MORE ILL-AFFECTED BY COOKED AND PROCESSED FOODS?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Some ailments are a direct result of a lack of enzyme-mutations for handling certain cooked foods.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This causes the toxic resins and residues from those cooked and processed foods to accumulate.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,These ailments are basically allergies to those cooked and processed foods.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Therefore, some people are more sensitive to and ill-affected by cooked foods than others."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Fat resins, especially from vegetable oils, and protein residues from cooked or processed green foods first collect in intestinal cells."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Coincidentally, some people entered a detoxification period at the same time they began this Primal Diet."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, the detoxification was not directly caused by the change of diet."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Their bodies were detoxifying accumulated toxins that were in their bodies from the mass quantities of toxins from cooked, processed and chemically grown food prior to the diet change."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Some bodies crave so much sleep that some people sleep more during the first month or two on a raw diet.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Sleeping more is healthy because it promotes healing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Most healing occurs during sleep.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Yet some people sleep less than before they began the raw diet because they don’t spend so much energy on digestion and toxicity.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"ALCOHOL: For some people, raw organic wine is beneficial."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It helps break down and remove some hardened fat from the blood and body.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, any kind of alcohol robs the liver of fat."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This weakens the liver and causes it to become lethargic.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eating 2 raw eggs within 10 hours of consuming raw wine restores fat to the deprived liver.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Most often it is healthier to eat raw unripe pineapple, raw lemons, or raw oranges to dissolve hardened fat rather than to drink alcohol."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,BUTTER/HONEY MIXTURE is made of equal portions of unsalted raw butter and unheated honey.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Where raw butter is not available, the following 3 alternatives may be substituted in the remedies that suggest the butter/honey mixture: 1) raw avocado mashed with an equal portion of unheated honey; 2) fresh coconut cream (juiced from the meat of fresh whole coconut) mixed with an equal portion of unheated honey, or 3) a stone-pressed or cold-pressed-below-96 Fahrenheit oil mixed in equal portions with unheated honey."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Those alternatives produce similar effects, but in some cases, take a little longer."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Here is a recipe that makes the honey/butter combination more desirable for some people: Place 1 cup of room temperature unsalted raw butter in a tightly sealed jar and immerse the jar in hot water that is not hot enough to burn your hand.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"While the butter is melting, blend 1⁄2 cup of shelled raw walnuts (or other soft nut) until it is powder."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When the butter is melted, add 4-6 tablespoons of unheated honey and the powdered nuts and blend."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This mixture can be refrigerated and kept up to 3 months.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,CANNED FOOD is cooked food.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Therefore, canned foods are all nutrient-deficient and difficult to digest and utilize."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Most canned and bottled food, like fruit and tomato purees and sauces, were rotten."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then they were very processed and chemicalized to hide the rotten taste.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Most of the hair mineral analyses also showed unnaturally high levels of lead, iron, cadmium and other toxic metals."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Cooking and storing food in metal vessels also cause gradual toxic metal-poisoning that helps disease blossom.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,CARBONATED BEVERAGES AND WATERS: If a label reads “carbonation added” or “carbonated” it means that the carbonation is synthetic.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Synthetic carbonation causes radicals and free radicals, resulting in mineral and oxygen deficiencies, sometimes resulting in headaches."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If a label reads “naturally carbonated”, or “natural carbonation added” or “naturally sparkling”, the carbonation is natural from the well and highly charged with healthful electrolytes."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Also, cheese draws the poisons from the blood, nervous and lymphatic systems as they pass through the stomach and intestines."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Unsalted raw cheeses act like a sponge to absorb those toxins, relieving nausea."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Since cheeses lack most bioactive enzymes, causing dehydration, eating raw fat with cheese, such as unsalted raw butter or coconut cream, helps prevent constipation."

to digest the fat, especially during stressful times."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, because the fat and sugar in chocolate are cooked and processed, they have a tendency to store in the body without being properly utilized, especially during stressful times, and should not be eaten."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Chocolate also contains the toxic nerve irritants caffeine and theobromine.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,CHOCOLATE SUBSTITUTES can be made by combining 4 parts raw fat to 1 part unheated honey.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"For instance, place 1⁄2 cup unsalted raw butter in a small canning jar and place it, with the lid tight, into a bowl of hot water to melt (water should be no hotter than your hand can stand without burning when immersed for 4 seconds)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After the butter is mostly melted, add 2-3 tablespoons unheated honey and 1-2 tablespoons raw carob powder."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,I suggest drinking 8-16 ounces first thing in the morning.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"That juice provides many nutrients that alkalize excessive and toxic acids in the stomach and blood, healthfully waking the body for the day."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The second choice would be to heat 5 ounces of good mineral water until it is not hotter than an immersed finger can tolerate for 4 seconds.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Stir in 2-5 tablespoons unheated honey and fresh juice of 1⁄2 lemon or 1 lime (optional: 1 tablespoon raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar).
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This mixture also supplies most of the enzymes necessary to get the blood and digestive system energized.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Concentrates do not promote health; they mostly damage health.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"COOKED FOOD is any food heated above 104° Fahrenheit, whether by baking, barbecuing, boiling, broiling, frying, irradiating, micro- waving, pasteurizing, steaming, stewing or toasting."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The destruction of enzymes is not significantly observable until cooking temperature reaches 118° Fahrenheit.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, I have consistently noticed subtle to substantial declines in digestibility when food is heated at 106° Fahrenheit for more than 2 minutes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I found that sick people digest food best when food is not heated over 104° Fahrenheit.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Pasteurized food is food heated between 140o-160° Fahrenheit.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Nowadays, almost every bottled food is heated to at least pasteurization temperature to kill what is alive in it, lengthening shelf life but decreasing nutrients for human life."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Irradiated food is food that has been exposed to radiation, more

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Even natural weather conditions above 104° Fahrenheit continuously for one or two
days can destroy nutrients by dehydration."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Utilizing refrigeration or cold cellars preserves many enzymes as well
as prolongs shelf life."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,COOKED STARCH: Eating cooked grain or potato starch is important for some people with excess hormones or toxicity.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The reason for eating a little cooked starch is that cooking releases starch and gluten that some individuals cannot obtain from any other source.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, most people can obtain raw starch from eating nuts in combination with raw fat and unheated honey."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"See Nut Formula, page 194."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Released starch or gluten can bind with excess neurological hormones and toxicity if the starch or gluten is refined, that is, without the bran and germ."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eating refined starch goes against the established concept that more fiber is better, but people rarely utilize starch and gluten in whole grain products because the starch and gluten often attach to bran and germ and cannot be absorbed. ("
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Also, cooked fiber robs the blood and intestines of available fats."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"That often causes dryness, irritability and/or lethargy.)"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If starch and gluten are not properly utilized, they will not arrest excess hormones, toxic hormonal byproducts, including psychological, and other related toxins."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Therefore, refined flours that are unbleached and not fortified or enriched are better for that purpose than whole grain flours."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Normally, the human body requires no vegetable or grain fibers on the Primal Diet."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As when eating any cooked food, eating too much cooked starch causes the accumulation of acrylamides and advanced glycation end products, creating obesity and/or cellulite, and diseases."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Generally, an individual should not eat as much cooked starch as she or he may crave."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eating small quantities of it when necessary reduces anxiety, depression, anger, symptoms of detoxification, etc."

because they obtain and utilize the starch that is present in raw meat, raw nuts and raw seeds (see Nut Formula, page 194), and raw vegetable juices."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, people who need cooked grain and/or potato starch may require it regularly for as long as two years."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After one to two years on a raw diet, cooked starch should be eaten sparingly or not at all."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Cooked starch may be cooked at normal recipe temperatures.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When putting unsalted raw butter, raw oils, self-made raw sauces and raw jams, and any other raw food on hot cooked starch, make sure that the starch has cooled to the point that it won’t burn the raw food."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"This temperature test can be done by sticking a finger deep into the hot food after steam no longer rises from it - if it is too hot for your finger, it will burn the raw food and diminish nutritive value."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Therefore, it is necessary to eat deep leafy green (for example, spinach or parsley) or purple (for example, red cabbage) vegetables or 4 ounces of their juice once weekly."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It is believed that large quantities of whole raw eggs should not be eaten because avidin (an amino acid) in egg white binds with biotin (part of the Vitamin B complex) in the body, causing side-effects."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The avidin/biotin bond is beneficial because it helps to dissolve biocarbons and helps muscles retain carbohydrates.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,That is why a diet resplendent in raw fat is so important to excellent health.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,People who eat diets low in fat often develop immune deficiencies sometime in their lives.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The body can, to some extent, turn sugars, starches and proteins into fats, but not nearly enough and it is a long and exhausting process for the body."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When fats are eaten raw, they can and will clean, fuel, lubricate and protect the body properly."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Most often the body utilizes the fat in raw eggs and avocado to bind with toxins, carrying the toxins to the bowels and from the system."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In the case of cellulite and other cooked fat that has bound to toxins and stored in the body, raw fruits and raw fruit puree (including raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar), and raw vegetables and raw vegetable juices gradually break down and releases those old storages of cooked fat."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eating raw eggs or avocados provides fat to bind with the released cooked fat and toxins and escorts them from the body.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Without the raw fat to escort toxins to the bowels, toxins often restore in the body."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Avocado is especially helpful for cleansing and strengthening the liver.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The fat in raw cream and full-fat raw milk soothes and lubricates nerves and muscles, including heart, gently cleanses and lubricates the liver, restores moisture to the thyroid and heals intestinal lesions from dryness."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Often drinking too much raw dairy cream causes bloating and slows digestion.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Dairy cream is the fat that is most complicated for the liver to digest.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Raw eggs and raw butter are easiest for the liver to digest.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The fat in unsalted raw butter strengthens organs and glands, heals eyes, cleanses arteries and vascular system, dissolving plaque made from hardened and/or crystallized cooked fats (mainly vegetable fats), chelates and escorts byproducts and waste from the body and lubricates bones, cartilage and teeth."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Fresh raw hot peppers, like jalapeño, banana and chile, promote good circulation, and prevent and expel parasites when very very hot."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"PRESERVATIVES AND PESTICIDES, airborne, or in or on foods, create volatile substances inside the body that are dangerous to the life of cells, often causing faulty development and functions, faulty production and utilization of body serums, cellular mutations and overall impaired cell and body constitutions."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Some people have severe reactions (allergies) to preservatives and pesticides, especially children: sores, eczema, psoriasis, nose bleeds, severe irritability, headaches, numbness, dizziness, panic, nausea, fatigue, anxiety and hyperactivity."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"See Edema, page 260; and Overweight, page 296."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,RAW BROWN SUGAR is a misnomer.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It is nothing other than table sugar with about 5% molasses added back to it.

REFRIGERATION AND STORAGE: Refrigeration that is too cold dulls taste."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Setting the refrigerator temperature no lower than 48° Fahrenheit ensures more taste.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As room temperatures fluctuate through seasons, so will refrigerator temperatures."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Adjusting refrigeration temperature every two months ensures more flavorful refrigerated foods.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Meats are best kept in the coldest area of the refrigerator but not frozen.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Raw meat wrapped, sliced or cubed and placed in large wide- mouth glass jars, usually keeps 10 days (the average is 7 days) without developing a strong odor."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The lid should be tight.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I found that raw poultry stays fresh 5-7 days without developing a strong odor when the bone and skin are removed and the meat is stored in glass jars with the lid tight.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, I have not experienced any problem with eating any meat when the smell was offensive."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Remember that I had my vagus nerve severed in surgery when I was 20.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I am supposed to be in danger of death from bacterial and parasitical invasion from raw meat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I have been eating raw meat full of bacteria and parasites for 29 years without ever experiencing food-poisoning.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I explain in my book The Recipe For Living Without Disease, more about bacteria and parasites in raw meat and the fact that they are healthful, rather than dangerous."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Raw meats stored below 38° Fahrenheit lose too many enzymes and flavor is subdued, often becoming almost tasteless."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Storing raw meat below 32° Fahrenheit destroys enzymes, vitamins and protein, and causes E. coli to mutate."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eggs should not be refrigerated.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Refrigeration destroys or damages too many enzymes and protein in eggs.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Therefore, when refrigerated, eggs are less nutritive, and harder to digest, assimilate, and utilize."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Egg may be nonrefrigerated for at least 4 weeks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,More about eggs is discussed in my book The Recipe For Living Without Disease.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Most fruits may be refrigerated to preserve their unripe state with more enzymes and less sugar.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, refrigeration quickly advances ripe bananas to the rotting stage, causing intestinal fermentation when eaten."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Any fruit that turns brown or becomes mushy in refrigeration should not be eaten.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Often, pears that have been frozen in commercial storage turn brown and mushy rather quickly after they thaw."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When thawed, they rot from the core outward causing intestinal fermentation when eaten."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Covering fruits with glass bowls or domes, or placing them in glass containers with lids and storing in refrigeration slows spoilage, keeps flavors alive longer, and prevents insects from feasting on them."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Raw butter can be left at room temperature and enjoyed soft for as long as two weeks, that is, unless room temperature exceeds 80° Fahren-heit."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Even if room temperature reaches 90° Fahrenheit, raw butter remains flavorful for two days or more unrefrigerated."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Do not expose butter to direct sunlight.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Exposing butter to sunlight for an hour or more causes it to sour.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I prefer to refrigerate my raw butter until the day before I use it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then I put 11⁄2 cups in a 2-cups wide-mouthed glass jar and leave the butter at room temperature so that I may enjoy my butter soft and flavorful.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Many people on this type of raw diet eat 3-8 ounces of butter daily and keep a daily schedule preparing raw butter for the next day or two.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Raw dairy never spoils, it simply becomes varieties of cheeses, including butter that becomes a blue cheese."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Raw cheeses last several weeks unrefrigerated in air-tight containers.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Like butter, no-salt-added raw cheeses are more flavorful at room temperature."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Some of my clients enjoy their no-salt-added raw cheeses left unrefrigerated for weeks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Some times a pungent white mold forms on cheeses.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The mold is beneficial for some people, that is, if strong cheeses are appealing."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, for some people, moldy cheeses cause listlessness that may last weeks."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Raw milk is best consumed soon after it has been taken from an animal.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, since most of us do not live on farms, raw milk keeps better in refrigeration."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Raw milk mixed with unheated honey and raw cream added, and stored in a dark cupboard without refrigeration lasts without souring for 3-4 days unless room temperature constantly exceeds 80° Fahrenheit."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If it separates, shake to remix it."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Oils that are properly cold-pressed or stone-pressed, that is, pressed below 96° Fahrenheit, should be kept from light."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Placing each bottle of oil inside a brown paper bag, pressing the bag around the bottle, putting a rubber band at the neck, and putting the oil in the darkest, coolest cupboard prevents the bottle of oil from turning bitter and/or flat."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Olive oil should not be refrigerated.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Because flax oil is so vulnerable to oxidation and light, it should be refrigerated."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If and when there is ever truly cold-pressed, non-solvent-extracted wheat germ oil available, it should be refrigerated."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Royal Jelly should be stored in refrigeration.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,SALAD DRESSINGS: An alkalizing salad dressing is 5 tablespoons each of raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar (or raw wine/vinegar) and unheated honey.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Optional ingredients are: red onion, fresh chile, fresh herbs, raw plain kefir (when available), raw cream (when available) and raw fertile egg."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Unless combined with an equal portion of raw vinegar, avoid oils on salads because the nutrients in the salad foods will be bound by the oils and unable to alkalize the blood and body."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, it is okay to eat raw oil, like unsalted raw butter or stone-pressed olive oil, on cooked starch such as pasta or bread, during the same meal with a salad - the starch keeps the oil free from coating and penetrating the salad foods."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"See Wine/Vinegar Dressing, page 202."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Mineral salts are plant-food, not food for humans."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If they were food for humans, we could live on dirt."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The vegetable kingdom makes wonderful use of mineral salts, in balanced ratios, to grow healthfully and strong."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After they make the salts into bio-actively available substances, we can juice their leaves, stalks and roots to obtain concentrations of those salts."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"For example, here is a tomato sauce: Press 4 tablespoons unsalted raw butter against the inside walls of an 8-ounces canning jar and put a lid on it tightly."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Place the jar into water that is as hot as your fingers can stand without burning them.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"While the butter melts for 5-10 minutes, slice one medium tomato that is room temperature and then blend it with the melted butter and fresh raw herbs, fresh raw pepper, fresh raw onion and fresh raw garlic if you like."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Pour that mixture over raw meat, or not-too-hot pasta or bread, and top with grated no-salt-added raw cheese."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In the book, The Recipe For Living Without Disease, there are 82 sauces that can each be made 3-5 different ways."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"SMOOTHIES: When I mention smoothie, I mean a drink made with raw eggs blended with a raw fresh fruit or raw fresh fruit puree and unheated honey."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"See Eggs, page 184."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"SUGARS: Table sugars and sugar sweeteners (refined sugars, sucrose) are all made from processing sugar cane or sugar beets at temperatures around 320° Fahrenheit."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They interfere with and damage digestion, glandular and nerve health and functions."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Fructose is the sugar from fruit (as opposed to sucrose which is the sugar from vegetables).
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Sweeteners made of fructose are also processed and cause as many similar complications as sucrose.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Fructose is the lesser of two evils.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Unheated honeys, raw fruit and raw juices are the only sweeteners that promote better health."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,SUGAR SUBSTITUTES are inorganic chemicals.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They are debris that create toxins and damage health.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Unheated honey and raw fruits are the only sweeteners that promote better health.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,TURKEY builds strong lymph and membranes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Turkeys produce an enzyme during molting season which can make some people sick when eaten raw.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Some people should avoid eating raw turkey from early Spring through Summer.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If you have a taste for turkey during molting

UNDERSTANDING HEALTH THROUGH FOOD 201 season, most likely you are not ill-effected by this enzyme and it may
be important for you to eat raw turkey during molting season."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,VANILLA EXTRACT should be organically grown and should contain its natural alcohol.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Its nutritional properties stimulate the thyroid when a thyroid is inactive, or when it is needed to balance a sluggish glandular system."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Vanilla extracts that have had the alcohol removed are less effective.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Some people become hyperactive and develop insomnia if they consume vanilla extract too often or too late in the day.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"See Coffee Substitute, page 182."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"VEGETABLES: Whole vegetables should only be eaten when craved; see page 147, about digestibility of vegetables."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, when eating vegetables - leafy, root and stalk foods - most often they should be eaten without oil dressings."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Drinking very fresh raw gel of aloe vera, or juice of yam, in combination with other vegetable juices such as carrot and parsley, most often increases healing and decreases suffering."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,VEGETABLE JUICES help alkalize overly acidic blood.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They are also a means of supplementing our vitamin, enzyme and mineral deficiencies."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Vegetable juices should mainly be celery with a little parsley.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,See the book The Recipe For Living Without Disease.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Children under 15 should only have vegetable juices occasionally, if necessary for a particular ailment or following a cold or flu, and regularly maybe once every 10-22 days."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,VOLATILE TOXINS are substances entering the body or substances altered to a state within the body that create harmfully acidic and sometimes allergic reactions.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They can negatively alter RNA and DNA, enzymes, hormones, cells and tissue, affecting the entire body."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They can be the result of: low-grade mineral poisoning caused by eating canned food, preservatives, pesticides and medication; exposing oneself to chemicals, pesticides and other pollution; from an excess of

We_Want_To_Live.txt,WATER dries the body.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Drink water rarely.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Analogy: continually applying water to skin dries and cracks the skin.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Oiling the skin protects and preserves the skin.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It is the same inside our bodies.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eating tomatoes quenches thirst best.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Dry lips and mouth are not dehydration.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The brain discards many toxins, especially metals, through the gums and tongue, absorbing and spending all available fats in and surrounding oral tissues."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"That leaves the mouth and lips very dry, but it is not dehydration but fat deficiency."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Placing 1 tablespoon of unsalted raw butter with a dab of unheated honey on the tongue and keeping them in the mouth for 5-10 minutes reverses dry mouth and lips.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Drinking fresh raw milk, cream and kefir, fresh raw vegetable
juices, unheated honey, and eating fresh unripe fruit provides H20 rich in electrolytes, enzymes, minerals, vitamins and fats that prevent
drying."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"A wonderful thirst-quenching drink is a blended mixture of 2 cups peeled cucumber, 3-6 tablespoons coconut cream and 1 tablespoon unheated honey."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Of that mixture, drink 2-3 ounces at a time throughout the day."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"See Appendix M, page 143."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"WINE/VINEGAR DRESSING, RAW, for salads, can be made and refrigerated up to one week only."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"One suggested recipe is: Blend 1/3 cup of raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar, 1/3 cup raw organic wine, all or a portion of 1 fresh hot pepper (red, yellow banana, red or orange or black jalapeño and chilies), 1⁄2-4 tablespoons unheated honey, and a slice of purple onion."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Use as much fresh hot pepper as desired but the dressing should have a little bite from the pepper.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"For some people, the sweetness of the honey in the dressing is not appealing; those people should have it with less honey or without honey."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,For some people the opposite is true; those people should add more honey. (
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This is the dressing that is imperative for those people who lack enzyme- mutations and need to remove the accumulated toxic residues and resins from years of eating cooked green and cooked red foods.)
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"For another salad dressing, decrease the amounts of wine and vinegar to 1⁄4 cup each and add 1⁄4 cup raw plain kefir (when available)."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eat it with whatever meets your fancy - fruit, salads, popcorn (?!)"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,or other cooked starch or raw meat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,YOGURT is similar to kefir.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, yogurt is always made with heated milk and will not thicken unless the milk is heated to at least 115° Fahrenheit."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Most store-bought yogurt is made from pasteurized milk and is an inferior food.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Raw kefir is considerably superior.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Conversations About the Primal Diet
I conclude this section by sharing parts/composites of the email exchanges between Sheri, who is a mother of 5 and has been on the diet for about 4 years, and an acquaintance Cari, a woman who was a dissenter of my Primal Diet, and finally me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Sheri,
Didn't you feel this strongly about a vegan diet too?"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"This diet says no water, this diet says no starch, this diet says no salt, this diet says eat eat eat."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That will burn out your organs.

Hello, Cari,
Again."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I have already considered the objections you posed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I have read, studied and applied principles of nutrition and its relation to our physical, mental and emotional health for many years, and also have put these principles to the test to see what really works."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"My husband may be smart in many ways, but he is not in great health and even has some fairly serious pre- cancerous symptoms."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He may have a strong genetic health which has allowed him to be abusive to his body thus far, but he will need to consider making changes in his own diet, if he wishes to continue into old age in good health."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I look to Dr. Pottenger’s studies and see such a mirror image of what happened to his cats and what is happening to humans today regarding the lack of health we are all experiencing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I attribute many factors, not just diet to the cause of it all."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"But because we have been assaulted by vaccines, medications, processed foods, and pollutants of every sort, we must take what seems to be extreme measures to reverse it."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"We did not have the healthy start that our parents and grandparents had with breast milk, or raw milk and wholesome foods, and free of vaccines and other chemical pollution."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I am most certain that raw food reverses disease because I have witnessed it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I have personally witnessed over and over again, the negative affect on physical and mental health when eating junk food and YES even cooked food."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I conclude that it is because our organs and glands are so toxic, that even a little cooked food will give us some symptoms."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I am sorry, but you are not going to convince me."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As I have said, I have been there, done that, thought that already."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I also do not think that because I have not made all the right choices in the past regarding diet, makes me wrong today."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,As humans we must progress a little at a time.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Change is a gradual thing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I learned very much from being a raw vegan, and even though it was nutritionally deficient, it still showed me that raw foods heal and make one feel better."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"By the way, Aajonus is not using me or anyone to promote his business."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Those of us who have benefited from his knowledge and the diet, wish to share that with others."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Aajonus is one of the few people I know who is not given to pride and greed.

Hello Aajonus,
I think that whenever we are persecuted for this diet, it gives us some consolation if you read and comment on the exchange, only if you have time, of course."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Hope you are well.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Yours,
Sheri
Hi, Sheri,
If anyone claims to have read my first book 10 times, we must
ask, “Why did that person misquote me on water, starch, sleep and salt?”"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,About water: I recommended that we minimize the drinking of water because very little water can be absorbed by our cells and dries the skin and membranes of cells.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I suggested drinking more milk and vegetable juices, and eating tomatoes and cucumbers."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,All of those foods and all raw foods contain H2 O that can be cellularly utilized.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I said in my first book that some people should drink a lot of water for awhile.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"About starch: I said in my first book that starches are very necessary, even to the point that I recommended that a few people go against the main principle of eating raw food."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I suggested that they would benefit from eating simple, cooked starches sometimes, like unsalted bread, etc."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"But, because I later observed the collection of toxins even when those people ate plenty of raw fat with the cooked starch, in my second book and in the revision, I advise that necessary extra starch be derived from eating the Nut Formula as much as possible."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Note that all meat contains starch.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"That is what herbivores eat when they eat seeds of grasses, especially their preferred seeds, those that have fallen to the ground and dried."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,About salt: It is a fact that people need sodium but not necessarily salt.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When people drink salt water, they get sick."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eating salt is helpful in cultures that eat only a little meat and lots of starch because those people are prone to tapeworms and excessive pinworms.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Salt dehydrates intestinal parasites.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Some salt is helpful to people who eat cooked food and cannot utilize enough sodium to counter all the toxicity that results from eating

UNDERSTANDING HEALTH THROUGH FOOD 207
cooked foods."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I said that people who have adrenal exhaustion should eat a little salt.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I said that most people who eat a raw diet should not eat salt, including sea salt."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,About sleep: I stated in my books that sleep is very important because 90% of healing happens for most people in the sleep state.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After my 32 years of eating raw food, I said that I need only 4-5 hours of sleep daily, unless I am in an intense healing state."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Sometimes I have needed 6-12 hours of sleep per day.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Most people need 7 -10 hours of sleep.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I did not say that everybody needs only 4-5 hours sleep.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,About greed: I could have compromised many times and made fortunes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wrote a diet for a woman named Judy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It was for a certain period of her life, for her to temporarily lose weight."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Judy wrote a book of the diet called The Beverly Hills Diet and made a fortune.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That diet is harmful to the nervous system if followed for more than a few days or weeks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It often made people very testy and/or irritable.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Many people who followed that diet damaged their nervous systems, family relationships and friendships."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I refused to do that harm to people for money.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In 1971, on moral principle, I refused to be the Winston man in commercials, rejecting $7.5 million over the next seven years."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You are a very intelligent woman who has experimented and found that the Primal Diet promotes healthy emotional behavior for yourself, as well as for members of your immediate family and many of your acquaintances."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You are blessed with a particular sensibility.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I suggest that you trust your reality.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It may be a waste of time to try to educate people about the science of nutrition if they are new to the diet and their thinking is clouded because they believe that they know everything from only a few months, or even a few years of eating some of the Primal Diet."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Also, some people have learning and comprehensive disorders along with frustration, fear and impatience."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They are unable to see the nutritional puzzle clearly, even though they think they see it clearly."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I do not know what can be done for them but it seems like a waste of energy to allow it to frustrate us.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"T H E P R I M A L D I E T Obtaining The Foods We Want And Need
Some foods necessary for optimal health, and for the remedies that follow, are not available in all states in the USA."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Fresh raw dairy is commercially available only in a few states.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In some states, fresh raw dairy is sold only at the farm."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Some farmers have to label their raw milk “For animal consumption” or “For pets only”.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I will consume raw milk from cows fed raw feed and that do not receive hormones or antibiotics.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I prefer organically fed, but it is not always available."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The rulings that fresh raw dairy cannot be available commercially to the people in most states is prejudicial.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Health freedom is denied.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,You may regain this right if enough people from each state petition their state government.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The process, reports and documents to change legislation to permit raw dairy to be sold are on the internet at www.RawMilk.org."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Find a dairy farm that feeds their cows organically and produces raw dairy products.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Or buy and start organic raw dairy farms as individuals, or as cooperatives."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"For any other foods that may not be available in your locale, the need and demand create the product."

Brief Preparation Guide
For recipes, instructions and suggested meal plans, buy the book, The Recipe For Living Without Disease."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It contains 150 recipes, including raw cheesecakes, raw pies, raw meat recipes, and 82 raw meat sauces that can be made 3-5 different ways each."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That means there are approximately 400 sauces to help you enjoy raw meat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"BLENDING MADE EASY: Buy a blender, such as Osterizer."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The base of the blender, where the blades fit, should be the size of a regular, small-mouthed, glass Ball canning jar (the 21⁄2 inch diameter mouth, not the 31⁄4 inch diameter mouth)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The rubber sealing ring, stainless steel blade, and the threaded plastic bottom of the blender screw onto the mouth of a regular, small-mouthed canning jar (in that order, that is, one side of the rubber sealing ring should be against the mouth of the jar and the other side against the base of the steel blade)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Note: As of April 2005, the rubber sealing rings for the Osterizer are too thin and small, so that a proper seal is not made with the jar, causing food to leak from the jar while blending - very messy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Therefore, buy a rubber
washer that is made for another blender."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Buy one that is at least 3/16 inch (1⁄2 mm) thick and slightly larger than the circumference of the blade-plate.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Then buy or collect regular, small-mouthed canning and jelly jars in an assortment of sizes: 4, 8, 12, 16 and 32 ounces."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Select the size of jar that is appropriate for the job, such as a 4-ounces jar to make a sauce for 1-2 people."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Before blending food, make certain that the blades do not strike or cut into the glass jars during blending."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If one blade strikes the glass, bend it upward so that it does not strike the glass again."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Usually, one blade strikes the glass on only 4-ounces-sized jars."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Place ingredients into the jar.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Place the rubber sealing ring on the rim of the jar.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then place the steel blades inside the jar.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The metal base of the blades will rest on top of the rubber sealing ring.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Make sure that the sealing ring does not fall into the jar.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If any part of it does, it will become twisted around the blade, causing profuse leakage and possibly damaging the sealing ring."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Finally, screw the plastic base over the base of the blades and onto the jar."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Turn the jar upside down and place it on the blender and blend.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If you hear an unusually low frequency or high vibrational sound when you turn on the blender, turn it off

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"THEPRIMALDIET
immediately, unscrew the threaded bottom, remove the blade and untwist the rubber sealing ring from around the blade."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Realign the ring properly (if torn, use another sealing ring - have several sealing rings on hand because that occasionally happens)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Absolutely do not blend any substance harder than shelled raw almonds in a glass jar because the jar might break and the glass could injure someone.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,DISSOLVE HONEY easily and quickly into any liquid or food to puree by blending it in the appropriate sized canning jar.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Always put honey in the jar last and blend immediately, especially if other ingredients are cold from refrigeration; otherwise the honey will turn hard and stick to the sides of the jar."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"See Blending made easy, above."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"DRINK FOR MOISTURIZING AND LUBRICATING DRY AND/-OR HARDENED INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TISSUE (e.g., dry skin and hair, arthritis, sclerosis, and cirrhosis of the liver): Blend 1-2 raw eggs, 3-6 tablespoons unsalted raw butter (or other raw fat, but butter is best), 1-11⁄2 tablespoons fresh raw lemon juice and 2-6 teaspoons unheated honey."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"That drink has a lemon-meringue taste that appeals to most people, and works quickest to relieve dryness, stiffness and hardening."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,JUICING A COCONUT: Choose a coconut by inspecting its shell.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If you find any cracks or dark watermarks, small or large, or black spots, it is probably soured."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Inspect the three small dark circles grouped together at the top, called eyes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If one of the eyes is open or shrunken, it is soured."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If the coconut is without any of the above, the odds of having a good coconut are 9 of 10."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Juicing coconuts can seem like a chore but the healthful rewards are worth the effort.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"You will need leather gloves that are not heavily dyed, an ice pick, hammer, curved-ended oyster knife, and a juicer that separates cream from pulp, such as a GreenStar 1000 juicer."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Poke the coconut eyes until you find the eye that is soft.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Do not puncture it, yet."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Puncture one of the hard circles with the ice pick and hammer.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then puncture the soft circle with the ice pick.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Pour the coconut milk into a glass.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Taste the milk.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If it is sour, the coconut may be partially or completely soured."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If the coconut milk (often referred to

FOOD AS REMEDY 211
as coconut water) is good, drink it when thirsty."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Don gloves.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"To loosen the meat from the shell, firmly tap coconut all around for 2 minutes but not hard enough to crack it yet."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Now, crack the coconut shell at the end opposite from the three eyes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Hammer the coconut into many pieces.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If you find some of the meat yellow or discolored, it is partially soured."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Pry the meat from the shell with the oyster knife.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If black spots appear on the brown skin, it is molded where the spots appear."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Separate the non-soured meat from the soured meat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If it is completely soured or moldy, begin again with another coconut."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Slice good coconut pieces into strips that are approximately 1⁄4-inch thick by 1⁄2-inch width and any length.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Or (easier!)
We_Want_To_Live.txt,drop the chunks of coconut into a food-processor and grind.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Place the coconut meat slices or ground coconut into a juicer that separates cream from pulp, such as a GreenStar or Champion juicer."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The result is coconut cream that will thicken as hard as butter in refrigeration.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Use the pulp to fertilize a garden or lawn, or sun dry it to make a coconut confection for recipes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Do not mix the coconut milk with the coconut cream unless you intend to drink it within 24 hours, or it will sour."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It is best to store coconut cream in many 4- or 8-ounces glass jars.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Blend 1⁄2 teaspoon lime juice with each 8 ounces coconut cream.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Storing in that manner in refrigeration will preserve it for up to 7 weeks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Note: Since making coconut cream requires time and tools, it is recommended that you juice 5-10 coconuts at a time."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Each coconut renders 6-8 ounces of pure cream from the preferred metal twin-gear juicer (such as Green Star) not including the coconut milk.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"PÂTÉ is made by cutting meat into cubes, then putting them into a food processor and chopping them until they are paste."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"POULTICES are made by blending, chopping, crushing, grating, mashing or mincing raw food, and then wrapping it in a clean white cloth (cotton, cheesecloth, muslin or silk)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That is then applied to an affected external area of the body.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Put a strip of cloth around the poultice to hold it in place, not too tightly."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When the poultice dries in several hours, replace it with fresh ingredients."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The cloth should always be thoroughly rinsed before adding or replacing ingredients, and the final rinse should be with good mineral water."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"212
Nature should not be feared; She is healing, vital and loyal."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Our bodies should not be feared; they are part of Nature and are always in the process of healing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"While eating our way to better health, it should be remembered that healing often takes time, endurance and requires patience."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I wish you a richly healthy life.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"VITAL FOOD REMEDIES
I have recommended that my clients acquaint themselves with all of the ailments listed throughout this section because most people have many of these ailments, but not to the extent that they can be diagnosed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I have suggested that they highlight all of the sentences that have applied to them sometime in their lives.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Highlighting makes it easier to locate applicable symptoms, explanations and remedies."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Symptoms were usually alleviated and ailments usually mitigated in people who ate the foods that I had specifically recommended for their ailments.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Where more than one food or combination was recom-mended, I suggested that they eat all that was recommended but not all at one meal."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When someone desired more food than was specifically recommended, I suggested that they supplement the recommended food with food that constitutes a balanced raw diet."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,See the book The Recipe For Living Without Disease.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They chose the foods that they desired, then prepared and ate them raw."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Consequently, the speed of healing increased."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But people who did not continue to eat raw food on a regular basis did not heal properly.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Because optimal healing needs proper nutrients and takes time, their ailments gradually returned."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Ailments that did not heal usually advanced.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Detoxification and healing - to the point that people no longer felt hindered by advanced ailments - took weeks, months or years, depending on severity."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Symptoms of ailments that quickly mitigated usually returned, indicating that more thorough cleansing and healing was required for better body functions."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When symptoms lingered because the body continued a process of cleansing and healing, or when symptoms mitigated quickly and then returned for more cleansing and healing, people sometimes became disconcerted

FOOD AS REMEDY 213
and discouraged."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Doubts rooted.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, everyone who held fast to eating the raw diet experienced proper cleansing and healing, mitigating the severity of their ailment(s), often to the point that eventually they forgot they had had the ailment."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"People who trusted in Nature’s raw-food precedence, and to a degree in their instincts and intuition, with endurance, patience and time, most often achieved significantly better health."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Throughout Volume 1, I gave examples of the many healthy rewards I obtained using courage and patience when going through a major detoxification and eating a raw diet."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I will give you another, here."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Immediately prior to the first printing of this book in 1996, a violent rash erupted on my nose, around the inside of my left eye and the top center of my forehead at my hairline."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"On the second day, the rash looked as if it were developing into karposi, accompanied with chronic headaches."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I did not have AIDS but was concerned.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I used my salve for burns, ate raw chicken every 4 hours, ate 8-12 raw eggs daily and drank raw milk constantly to keep pain to a minimum."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"By the fourth day, small blisters formed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I released the pus on several but it was not enough for a laboratory test.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"On the fifth day, a chunk of my skin fell off near my burned eyeball."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I became alarmed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I quieted myself and took the skin to a lab and requested that they test for chemical and medical toxins as well as cancer.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The laboratory reported listed components used in aerospace/dental epoxy, and basil- cell melanoma."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Since my nose was the primary focus of tissue, the lab technician asked me if I had splintered my nose."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,He told me that some plastic surgeons use epoxy in such cases because they can’t pin a shattered nose together.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I told him that when I was fifteen, my nose was shattered by a hard ball going about 60 mph thrown by an adult."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My nose shattered into seven pieces.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It took two major surgeries to correct it over seven years.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The first surgeon told me that the surgery took 6 hours.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He did not tell me why, or that he had glued my bone together using aerospace/dental epoxy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The technician explained that, during an operation such as the one I’d undergone, the surgeon would have normally cut and pulled the skin covering my nose, and would have clamped it to my forehead."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Then, he would have had to allow each spot-glued piece of bone to dry before gluing the next fragment."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"He would have had to let the epoxy dry

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"T H E P R I M A L D I E T
completely, because if wet epoxy were to have come into contact with tissue softer than bone, the epoxy would have burned and melted it."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Almost 30 years after that surgery, my body decided to detoxify the epoxy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The epoxy-detoxification process took six weeks.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If I had panicked and gone to a dermatologist, I would have been given antibiotics, steroid ointments, radiation and chemotherapy, adding more toxins to my body, and scarring my face as well."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Now my face, skull and brain have the opportunity to live and function healthier, better and more efficiently."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Already, my sense of smell is keener, and food tastes better."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I’m hoping that the scars and damage to my left cornea, nose and forehead where the dissolved epoxy, causing cancer, burned my eye and burned massive holes in my skin will heal."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"One year after that cancer in 1997, my left cornea contained 8 layers of scars and vision loss to 20/180."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Almost 8 years later, an eye exam revealed only 1 layer of scar remained and my vision improved to 20/40."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I have observed consistently that the body always gains more than it loses during a detoxification.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I trusted it that time, too, and I am not disappointed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Because eating raw food provides the nutrients for the body to properly cleanse (detoxify) as well as heal and rebuild, natural cleanses (such as colds, flu, and temporary aches and pains) should be welcomed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They may occur 1-4 times a year.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Cleanses (detoxification) have been shorter in duration and less debilitating than cleanses that occurred before my Primal Diet.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Almost everyone on the balanced raw Primal Diet felt more energy and vitality during and immediately after a natural cleansing than they had experienced when on cooked diets.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Note that sometimes different ailments resulted from similar overall problems in different people.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"For instance, a frequently high adrenaline level in one person caused acute hardening of the arteries, while in another person it caused Candida, and in another person it caused cataracts."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Some elderly people who had a lifetime of accumulated cooked-food residues or chemicals (for instance, years of medication, or exposure to household or industrial chemicals and gases) spent the remainder of their lives in painful detoxification."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Consequently, I learned that it is sometimes more important to feel better while getting a little healthier."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Therefore, now I suggest to my elderly clients who find themselves going through an uncomfortable detoxification that lasts more than

FOOD AS REMEDY 215
three months, that they bathe as suggested under Detoxification."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"See Detoxification, Stopping It, page 255."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The less beneficial alternative for stopping painful persistent detoxification for the elderly is to eat a cooked meal once weekly.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A cooked meal discourages continual detoxification of old stored toxins.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"One cooked meal each week of baked, broiled or boiled chicken, not fried, usually stops and prevents extreme detoxification of old toxins stored in the body."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Volatile toxic conditions are ailments where highly reactive toxins have accumulated, whether in the blood, nerve-serum, lymph, connective tissues, muscles, bones, glands or organs."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It is a state in which live cells in the affected area(s) or system(s) are vulnerable to severe irritation and cellular destruction (as in my example above).
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Excess hormonal production (for instance, adrenaline and insulin) along with pollution, or not eating enough raw fat and meat, or not drinking raw fresh vegetable juices, frequently causes volatile toxic conditions."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Drugs (medicinal and recreational), coffee, chocolate, processed peppers and sugars, pesticides, preservatives and sodas all irritate and overstimulate adrenals and pancreas, creating volatile toxic conditions."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Symptoms of excessive adrenaline are: hyperactivity and/or irritability and very dry skin or hair.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eating the foods suggested for alkalizing the blood balances the blood within 2-10 days (see Alkalizing Food, page 178)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Symptoms of excessive insulin are hypoglycemia, irritability and edema."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Completely refraining from eating ripe fruit and high-carbohydrate vegetable juices helps relieve that condition.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Completely neutralizing all of those conditions has taken up to 10 years.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Drinking 1-2 cups of naturally sparkling mineral water daily helps restore the electrolyte balance and oxygen level in the blood and reduces adrenaline production.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eating 3 ounces of unheated honey daily and 1-4 cups of raw fresh green vegetable juices at least five days weekly for the rest of one’s life, gradually replaces enzymes lost or leached from years of eating cooked food."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"For optimal health, research and experience have conclusively proved to me that all food, except raw oils, should not be heated above 104° Fahrenheit."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Raw oils should not be heated above 96 Fahrenheit.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,T H E P R I M A L D I E T The following remedies have worked an average of 85% in all cases.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, by man’s laws, they are not prescriptive."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When beginning the Primal Diet, a person who has not eaten many fresh foods such as raw fruits, raw juices and raw salads, may do better eating more raw fruits, an occasional salad and lots of unheated honey."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Also, there are people who have diseases for which the body requires more fruit until the disease is reversed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, after those people have eaten the Primal Diet for 1-2 years, I have observed that better health and mitigated symptoms have been achieved quicker by limiting fruit intake to once daily in the afternoon."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"A person who exercises may need more fruit, but usually in combination with a raw fat."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"ABORTION: Scraping of the uterus (D&C) may cause scarring; See Stretch Marks, Scars And Wrinkles, page 338, about removing scar tissue."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"See Hemorrhage, page 210, to stop an excessive bleed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"See Family Planning for more natural abortive methods, page 333."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,ABSCESS is a localized infection (detoxification) accompanied by pus externally or internally.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,An abscess is helpful because it is a process of dissolving and discarding volatile toxins from tissues.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Externally, packing the abscess with a little clay that has been pre-mixed with good mineral water into a thin paste, and then applying a bandage over it absorbs and neutralizes volatile toxins."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Clay is best premixed as instructed under Clay.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The abscess will, most often, come to a head in a couple of days and burst on its own when as much toxicity as the body plans to remove is brought to the surface."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"See Clay, page 181."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In the case of an abscessed tooth, eating at least 15 medium-sized tomatoes per day neutralizes the condition."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eating no-salt-added raw cheese with tomatoes helps to reduce abscessed tooth pain and promotes healing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"With an abscessed tooth, blending the tomatoes into puree makes them drinkable."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The cheese may be blended with tomatoes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Also, see Pain Formula, Chapter 15 in the book The Recipe For Living Without Disease."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,ACNE often comes from not having the enzyme-mutations for utilizing cooked red and orange fruits and vegetables.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The fat from cooked red

FOOD AS REMEDY 217
fruits and vegetables cannot be broken down, assimilated, or utilized properly, forming resins and residues."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Therefore, the body binds the resins and residues with numerous white cells (antibodies) and fat molecules."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then the body tries to discard the mass through the skin.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Because of the chemistry or size of the mass, or the sharpness of residues (often like glass) the toxins burn, split, or lacerate cellular walls of the skin as they pass though the pores, creating lesions."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"This causes cellular sores that weep, forming pus (acne) and causing scars."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Avoiding cooked red- and orange-pigmented fruits and vegetables (including all bottled or canned tomato sauces) usually eliminates acne.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"See If I Lack Enzyme-Mutations, What Foods Should I Avoid?,"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,page 174.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Topically: Applying a mixture of 1 tablespoon good mineral water, 1⁄2 teaspoon powdered sun-dried clay and a drop of stone-pressed olive oil soothes and usually prevents scars."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Or apply some Primal Facial Body Care Cream (from my recipe book).
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Or simply applying a dab of unheated honey soothes and promotes healing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eating a little cold-pressed-below-96o Fahrenheit fermented coconut oil or stone-pressed olive oil daily, 3 days weekly, helps remove and prevent scars."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eating live red or orange foods helps the body eliminate stored residues and resins from cooked red or orange foods through the bowels (and less through the skin).
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Drug residues, like those from cocaine, Novocain and Lydocain, require 200-4000 white and/or fat cells to arrest and eliminate one molecule of toxin."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"ADRENAL EXHAUSTION is characterized by weight loss, fears beyond what is “rational”, ridges in the nails in a length-wise direction, apathy toward most forms of effort, unusual loss of hair; and by feeling unable to keep the back straight, feeling that your legs could easily collapse from under you, and feeling chemically unbalanced no matter what you eat."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,People who have adrenal exhaustion often have an energy drop within 15 minutes of the same time every day.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eating the Nut Formula (page 194), or, less preferably, a cooked starch, like French, sourdough, and Italian breads with raw fat, 15 minutes before the energy drop is due each day, usually allows for normal energy levels."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,AGING in our “advanced” society is basically a process of body- deterioration leading toward disease and death.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"That deterioration is caused by accumulated toxicity, limited cellular reproduction, cellular mutations, and cellular exhaustion."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Aging and deterioration do not have to be synonymous.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Symptoms: loss of hair moisture, dexterity, skin tone, muscle tone, flesh tone, and strength."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Consuming a raw diet in which 40% of calories are raw fat prevents the “normal” process of body deterioration.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The body gradually or quickly deteriorates without fat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"At least 3% and up to 30% of that raw fat should be from raw milk, that is unsalted raw butter, raw cream, no- salt-added raw cheese, full-fat raw milk and raw plain kefir."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Raw full- fat milk soothes tissues best.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,About 50% of the human race needs starches to prevent aging.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Those people need starches to bind with toxins (including excess hormones) that stress the body.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,We may obtain that starch by eating a Nut Formula (page 194) once or twice each week.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Some people may need to eat a little cooked starch if they cannot digest the Nut Formula.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"AIDS: Owanza, a colleague, has observed that advanced symptoms of AIDS is partially related to the destruction of melanin."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Melanin stagnates when the lymph is in poor condition due to chemical inundation and clogging.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Melanin also stagnates from lack of enzyme-mutations, lack of lysine in unaltered states, poor retention of phosphorus due to liver damage, and ingestion of swollen, ruptured and corrupted molecules (nutrients) from heat processing."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The loss of the melanin creates impairment of oxygen absorption and prevents photosynthesis of light from the sun.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Advanced AIDS seems to be a disease of isolation, the person being unable to interact internally and externally, bio-chemically and ecologically."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The result is death through cellular suffocation.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,AIDS is not contagious.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,ALCOHOLISM is a disease that involves compulsively craving and drinking alcoholic beverages.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Most alcoholics do not breakdown cooked fat properly, so they crave alcohol to help breakdown cooked fat."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, the side effects are most often traumatic."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When an alcoholic stops drinking, he or she should consider that the liver goes through a drastic temperature drop (liquors artificially heat the liver)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The temperature drop causes the liver to go into shock (d.t.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eating at least 1⁄4 pound (4 ounces) of raw fish twice daily for three days helps the liver and most often prevents the d.t.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Continuing to eat raw fish for another week helps the transition from alcohol.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Processed alcohol destroys liver, pancreas and brain cells by the millions and robs tissues and cells of fluids."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eating raw meats and unheated honey replaces the enzymes and sugars absent in the radical alcohol (distilled or pasteurized liquors) that destroy the membranes around cells.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Raw meats and unheated honey also promote the chemical breakdown of radical alcohol.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A diet that is 45% raw fat would be the most healing for an alcoholic.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eating 1⁄2 cup nonsteamed dates with a raw fat in the mornings restores the thyroid and balances the sugar level.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Then eating small amounts of raw meats with raw fat, alternating with very small amounts of whatever fresh fruits (preferably unripe) that are appealing with raw fat throughout the day keeps the blood sugar level balanced."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If a craving for alcohol hits, blend a raw drink consisting of the juice of 5 limes, an avocado, 4 kiwis and 4 tablespoons of unheated honey to satisfy the craving."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When fresh kiwis

are not available, sun-dried non-sulfured kiwis are okay, or substitute 1 cup of live pineapple in place of the kiwis."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Some people crave alcohol because they lack certain enzymes that digest fat - the alcohol helps break down fat.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This particular type of individual is prone to hepatitis.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"For this type, eating a little unripe pineapple with raw fat usually supplies enzymes for fat digestion and stops the craving for alcohol."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"For those few who cannot produce their own body alcohol, drinking 2 ounces of organic raw wine once or twice weekly supplies the alcohol that is needed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eating raw cheese or raw fat immediately before drinking alcohol prevents a lot of damage.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"ALD is an accelerated deterioration of myelin (the covering over nerve networks) causing loss of concentration, uncommon dazes, convulsions, unmotivated fits, loss of motor control and coma."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,This is usually diagnosed in an advanced stage in children when the symptoms are very pronounced (as are most diseases).
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It has been lethal in children because without myelin the nerves have no protection or buffer.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eating stone-pressed olive oil, fresh raw fish and red meat or poultry at the same meal daily provides the body with the nutrients it needs to regenerate the myelin."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The key to these nutrients being properly utilized is drinking 1 drop of homeopathic quinine up to 5 times daily and eating up to 4 ounces of unheated honey daily.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"ALLERGIES are disagreeable sensitivities to particular foods, light rays or pollutants (including vapors from magazine and newspaper print, perfumes and colognes)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Some allergies are the result of airborne pollutants that the body cannot neutralize or detoxify and eliminate, including fibers from synthetic clothing (plastic)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Other allergies result from substances in foods, natural or man-made, that the body cannot digest, assimilate, or utilize."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,These substances become radical toxins that severely damage tissues with which they come in contact.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The same goes for allergies to cosmetics and soaps - if you can't eat it, don't put it on your skin."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Symptoms from airborne allergies: rash, sinus congestion, sneezing, coughing, headache, hay fever, asthma, high blood pressure, abnormal fatigue, dizziness and mental depression, and bleeds from mucus membranes, like nose bleeds and considerable blood in the feces."

Symptoms from food allergies: all of the above plus loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, stomach and intestinal ulcers."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eating plenty of raw fat with a Nut Formula, or a cooked starch, unheated honey and fruit (frequently live pineapple) most often corrects allergies."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Another reason for allergies is that a body may lack the enzyme-mutations to digest and utilize cooked minerals.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,People who lack mineral enzyme-mutations often have premature graying.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Drinking naturally carbonated mineral waters is helpful.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Some people who lack enzyme-mutations for cooked minerals have severe reactions to cooked fish.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eating raw fish with unheated honey heals this allergy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eating no-salt-added raw cheese with raw fish and honey usually speeds healing. (
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That does not mean that a person develops a mutation to digest and utilize cooked minerals.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It means the toxic minerals that are stored in the body are gradually removed.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then symptoms of allergy subside.)
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Another reason for allergies is that some people allow the body to get too cold, causing the body to burn all its blood fat."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That leaves radical minerals and toxins free to damage and constrict cells to the extent that they cannot absorb nutrients.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Taking care to keep the body warm with clothing or heat, and to feed the body raw fat alleviates this allergy-to- cold-weather condition."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Pollen-related allergies can most often be alleviated by eating up to 1⁄2 cup of fresh local pollen daily until symptoms subside.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In advanced cases, hardening has extended to ganglia, disrupting sensory as well as motor response patterns."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Alzheimer's is mainly the result of low blood protein levels over long periods, such as in vegetarianism or fruitarianism, or in someone who lacks enzyme-mutations for digesting and assimilating cooked or processed protein, or lacks enzyme- mutations for digesting and assimilating cooked or processed sugar, forming calcification along nerves, which erodes nerve tissue."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Another

factor that causes Alzheimer’s is accumulated aluminum from vaccines, canned food and beverages, aluminum cook-wear and chemtrails."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Aluminum destroys Zeta Potential causing high sediment in blood and neuro-serums and excessive clotting.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That often causes hardening and scarring in the brain.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Avoiding cooked and processed protein, including all meat, eggs, roasted nuts and nut butters, and avoiding cooked and processed sugar, including drinks, jams or jellies, steamed and/or sulfured fruits, any canned food, and deodorants that contain aluminum stops progression of this malady."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Usually, by the time Alzheimer's symptoms manifest, hardening and deterioration of nerve tissue is too advanced to reverse."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, recent indications lead me to believe that frequently eating fresh raw coconut cream with cucumber dissolves the hardening of nerves that causes Alzheimer’s, effecting reversal in its early stages."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eating fresh raw coconut cream with banana, or eating 1 tablespoon daily of cold-pressed-below-96° Fahrenheit peanut oil with 5 drops of quinine water, gradually dissolves hardening of the arteries that feed the brain."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Also, drinking moldy water from rinsing moldy raw grains every 3 weeks for the rest of one’s life, and eating moldy grains once every 6 months for the rest of one’s life removes some hardening."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eating a raw-food diet with plenty of raw meats, especially fish, fresh raw fruit and Nut Formula strengthens mental functions."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Moldy grains are made by soaking 1/3 cup of one or more kinds of grain in a glass or ceramic vessel containing 6 ounces mineral water for three days, then pouring off the fermented water and drinking it immediately."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then the waste must be excreted and secreted.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The body has two basic methods for dissolving those cells.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The body’s natural and first choice is the action of bacteria, parasites and/or fungi."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Its second choice seems to be through the action of viruses.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Bacteria, parasites and fungi can consume degenerated or dead cells quickly, and the volume of the waste products produced by their cleansing action constitutes a mere fraction of the volume of the original toxic cells."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It is then relatively easy for our bodies to eliminate that waste.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The opposite is true with the action of viruses because viruses are crystalline solvents manufactured within poisonous toxic cells.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The waste from viruses is magnified and grossly distributed throughout the body.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Here, I will explain why the body develops and employs viruses."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Poisonously degenerative cells often kill bacteria, parasites and fungi."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When that occurs, our bodies no longer have the preferred assistance of those helpful agents in dissolving toxically sick or dead cells for elimination."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Resultantly, our bodies resort to manufacturing viruses to do that job."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Unlike the reduction of waste produced by bacteria, parasites and fungi, the waste produced by viruses increases because
viruses utilize volumes of H2O to dissolve and dilute dead and degenerative cells."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"That grossly toxic wastewater contaminates the
various circulatory systems (blood, nervous and lymphatic), spreading the toxicity throughout the body."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The actions of bacteria, parasites and fungi are always the most natural and preferred methods used by the body to detoxify dead and degenerative cells."

deficient in vital nutrients, bacteria, parasites, fungi, nor viruses can dissolve all the dead and degenerated cells."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,So our bodies must embalm those cells and contain them.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"First, the embalmed cells are dispersed throughout our bodies, intermixed with live cells, sometimes creating thick fibroids."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When our bodies reach the limit of their ability to tolerate so much dispersed dead cell structure, our bodies must construct tumors to contain the embalmed (dead) cells."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Building tumors is a means of isolating dead cells into a localized area so that the dead cells will have less impact on the functions of living tissue and bodily functions.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Tumors are built as benign or malignant.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In the case of malignant tumors, our bodies sparsely intermix live young mutated cells with many times more of the embalmed cells."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The young mutated cells are phenomenally designed to produce and contain potent solvents within themselves.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Those young mutated cells have been termed by medicine as cancer cells.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In the case of benign tumors, our bodies do not incorporate those young mutated cells that produce and contain solvents."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The difference between benign and malignant tumors is dramatic.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Our bodies, with the help of those young mutated (cancer) cells, can dissolve tumors rapidly, in 2 days to 5 years, depending on the size and number of tumors."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Without the help of cancer cells in benign tumors, most often our bodies must manufacture extra-cellular solvents to dissolve those benign tumors, from the outer edges inward, slowly."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Often, that can take from 5-40 years or never, if our bodies do not receive proper nutrients."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Therefore, idealistically, malignant tumors are preferable to benign tumors, as long as our bodies receive enough nutrients to neutralize and eliminate the tremendous amount of acrid waste that results from the quick dissolution of malignant tumors."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If our bodies cannot neutralize that acrid waste, the waste will injure, damage and dissolve adjacent living cells, such as in the case of an open cancerous lesion that grows and stinks."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,He testified before the congress that medical treatments were dangerous and always harmful long-term.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,There are three factors to address when eliminating and healing cancers.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The first is to stop eating cooked, processed and contaminated food that weakens or kills cells with toxicity and debris."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Avoiding fried foods is imperative because so many active and volatile toxins are by- products of frying. (
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"For identified toxins, see the book, The Recipe For Living Without Disease, Chapters 17 and 18.)"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The second is to fill the blood and body with raw fats that will dissolve and bind with dead cells and carry them from the body, or at least will neutralize toxicity, so that tumors will cease to grow."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"A very high blood-cholesterol level (between 250-400) made of raw fats, is almost always necessary."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The third is to dissolve tumorous tissue as safely as possible by eating fresh raw citrus or other fruit that is appealing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, if the tumor has broken the skin and is festering, it is already in the process of dissolving too rapidly."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In such a situation, restricting fruit and consuming large quantities of honey would be best to reduce acidity."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Following a balanced raw diet as suggested in the book, The Recipe For Living Without Disease, Chapters 8-12, has helped hundreds of people develop a high rate of cancer reversal if the cancer has not broken the skin."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,The reversal rate for lung and esophageal cancers has been approximately 60% without any medical treatments.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"With medical treatments, sadly, reversal rates decrease astoundingly."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,The exceptions were in cases that involved cirrhosis of tissues.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Then the diet had to be more complex.)
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Usually, indications of reversal were achieved within three months of beginning the diet."

Fourteen of those who died were malnourished and very thin."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They either refused to eat because of nausea or were unable to eat enough because of pain medication that destroyed their appetites and/or made them nauseous.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Vomit is a very healthy aspect of cancer reversal in many instances.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Vomit indicates that toxins dump into the stomach and our bodies want to expel them immediately.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As I mentioned, Owanza intermittently vomited up to 11 times daily for up to a 5-weeks cycle."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She recovered from 63 tumors.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It took her 11 years.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She is living and happy to this day, 24 years later."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Raw fats, including some oils, are tantamount for eliminating cancers and should be 30-45% of caloric intake."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Raw dairy products are very soothing to cancerous conditions, especially raw cream and unsalted raw butter."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Although fats are 80% responsible for eliminating the accumulated dead cells that cause cancer, fats do not work alone."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Protein, unripe fruit and green vegetable juices are essential catalysts."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eating fatty raw ground beef, and raw unripe oranges or fresh raw unripe orange juice (but not meat and oranges at the same meal) have brought about excellent results toward healing, as well as detoxifying cancers that have not broken the skin."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Unripe pineapple, or any unripe fruit that is appealing, can often be substituted for orange."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"For some people, drinking fresh raw vegetable juices may be more healing than oranges."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If experiencing anxiety, eating raw fish with whipped raw cream acts as a calmative."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Also, consuming the Nut Formula twice weekly helps to calm anxiety."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If those are not immediately available, eating raw fish with a little cooked starch and raw butter or with avocado or with another raw fat or raw oil works as a calmative."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In one case, breast cancer continued to advance to the point it broke the skin, becoming overly acidic."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I suggested an alkaline raw milk diet for 3 days with extra raw cream and unheated honey.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Also, I suggested fresh raw green vegetable juices."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The patient became severely painful, unable to move."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Her voice quivered from intensity of pain.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,I suggested that she immediately resume eating the normal Primal Diet suggestions for cancer and her pain mitigated within hours.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Through circulation, the body gets its nutrients."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Swimming or gentle movement on a regular or daily basis increases circulation to cancer-

congested areas of the body."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Applying heat to tumorous areas with a hot water bottle helps blood and lymph circulate to those areas, and once there, to cleanse and heal. ("

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Sex is good fun and is good exercise as long as it is not accompanied with anxiety.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Tomatoes contain lycopene that shrinks tumors, including prostate cancer, in cases when cancers have not broken skin."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Owanza discovered that eating 1 tablespoon of cold-pressed-below-96° Fahrenheit flax seed oil each day helps prevent tumor development.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I noticed that she drank 2 ounces of fresh raw lemon juice blended with 2 ounces of unheated honey and mixed with 4 ounces of naturally sparkling water 3-4 days weekly.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,None of her cancers broke the skin.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Remember, cancers that break skin are already too intensely dissolving tumors, so the object with those cancers is to slow the dissolution process by alkalizing the body with non-acidic and non-detoxifying foods."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That eliminates oils and reduces fruit consumption.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Along with what is suggested above, full-fat raw milk is very helpful for people who have cancer in and around the spine."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I suggest adding 3-4 tablespoons raw cream and 2 tablespoons unheated honey to each quart of milk for spinal problems, including cancer."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"For cancers in the groin area, such as prostate and lymph, eating raw fish with a Nut Formula, or a little cooked potato, as well as all that is suggested above, can be more effective."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"It has been Owanza’s experience that breast cancer in people who have consumed aspirin, other medications, and food additives and preservatives, or have been exposed to toxic chemicals for many years, requires surgical removal."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I have not yet come to that conclusion, even though I know that in many people, certain chemicals, like the compounds in aspirin, turn some cells into cement."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It is sometimes impossible to dissolve those cells to removable substances.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Unlike most tumorous tissue, cement-like cells cannot be dissolved and eliminated by the body."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"For a period of 43 years, she had consumed several bottles of aspirin each week for headaches."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"As soon as she began the Primal Diet, her headaches stopped and never returned, and her weight normalized within 41⁄2 years."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But her breast cancer could not be stopped because of 43 years of accumulated cemented cells.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When she died, her chest was overgrown with tumorous sores."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The other client was in her forties and in advanced stages by the time she came to me.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She was consuming appetite-suppressing dosages of morphine for pain.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After four months of eating as much as she could of what I suggested, her tumors began to dissolve (by more than 35%)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,But she could not eat enough to get strong enough.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The one client who Owanza lost to breast cancer was in her late thirties when she died.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She was raised and played next to a farm where the crops were dusted with pesticides.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A biopsy done and specifically analyzed for toxic substances that occur in many pesticides showed a very dense ratio of those compounds.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It had been about eighteen years since she had lived on that farm.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Another client I lost to cancer (not breast) was in her seventies and would not stop taking chemotherapy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,She went into a coma on the colonic table (I cautioned her about chemotherapy and colonics).
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"She was the first and last cancer-sufferer I accepted as a client who took chemotherapy and radiation during the experimental period where over 3,000 people tired the effectiveness of my Primal Diet (1984-2005)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Chemo- and radiation therapies are toxic and cause cellular genocide, amassing dead cells that are likely to be built into tumors throughout the body (metastasis), usually within 7 years of treatment."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,See pages 22-25.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When cancer occurs in an individual who has progressed cirrhosis of tissues throughout his or her body (or in one or more areas), it indicates that tissues are unnaturally polluted with compounds that cannot be easily eliminated."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If the body were to dissolve those tissues (cells), the by-products could be so poisonous that the body’s systems could be severely damaged or the person could suffer anaphylaxis."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Under such conditions, cancer remission has been questionable, and reversal (cure) has remained doubtful."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That is often the case in cancers that have broken the skin.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, two such cases surprised me after six years, by at least beginning to dissolve hardened tissues and creating soft new

tissue."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Bone deterioration that is sometimes found in conjunction with some
cancers is not directly part of the cancerous process (the process of containing - tumor - and then dissolving dead cells)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Bone deterioration results from a severe fat and mineral deficiency that is exacerbated in cancerous cases.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In those cases, the body leaches minerals and fat from bones to facilitate the isolation and neutralization of the waste from dissolved cells."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eating unsalted raw cheese with unsalted raw butter (or other raw fat) and raw ocean fish, especially raw scallops, oysters, clams and urchin, supplies fats and concentrated minerals so that the body does not have to leach them from bone."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Also, see Clay, page 181."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,CANDIDA is a yeast-like condition (detoxification) that eats little stagnant pools of blood that result from internal lesions caused by dryness and cracking of the tissues within the body.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Candida fungus cleans the system by eating degenerated tissue damaged by accumulated cooked carbohydrate-based, adrenaline- or insulin-related chemicals."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Candida is helpful and should have its cycle.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The worst thing anyone can do if he or she wants to improve his or her health is to destroy Candida.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Smoking puts a person at higher risk of developing Candida.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If a person has a high adrenaline level and drinks alcohol, he or she is putting herself at great risk of developing Candida."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Symptoms: a somewhat pallid complexion, sensitive and swollen extremities, dry skin, extreme lethargy, critical attitude, a general dislike for people, and a tendency toward isolation."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Soft drinks with caffeine, salt, alcohol, smoke, coffee, teas, and aspirin are all poisonous because they overstimulate the adrenals and pancreas, causing excess adrenaline and insulin that spends fat, creating the dryness that causes lesions, the storage of volatile toxins in tissues, and disturbing blood sugar levels."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When experiencing extreme symptoms, eating half of a Nut Formula once daily in the afternoon for 3 days helps remove toxic adrenalin and insulin."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eating a raw diet with cooked starch in combination with plenty of raw fat eliminates high adrenaline and insulin levels.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eating raw fish or organic raw chicken or turkey helps heal and restore damaged and dead nerve tissue and skin.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Raw beef and other red meat may be eaten when the condition is neutralized enough.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"A sign that a person is too toxic to eat beef is severe itching and irritability, accompanied with nausea after eating beef."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Drinking the freshest raw juice of 1 yam once every 4 days helps produce hormones that reduce the swelling and soreness in the joints as a result of Candida.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Yam juice should be consumed within 10 minutes after juicing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"To re-lubricate the joints and body, I suggest daily consuming the Drink for Moisturizing and Lubrication, page 210, but made with only 1-3 teaspoons of fresh raw lemon juice."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"To temporarily reduce rampant Candida, I suggest that you blend 4 tablespoons fresh lime juice, 1-2 tablespoons unheated honey and 1-2 tablespoons raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar together, add that to 4 ounces of naturally sparkling water, and drink 2 ounces every 4 hours for no more than 3 consecutive days."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In some individuals, that may cause increased symptoms for the several days but ultimately it reduces Candida proliferation."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,CANKER SORE is an open sore on the mouth that usually burns and tingles.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Topically, it is best not to apply anything."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Their eyes are completely deprived of certain utilizable fats.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The body can’t clean debris from the eyes properly and cataracts form.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Consuming 1-3 tablespoons of stone-pressed olive oil every day for the rest of a person’s life stops further development of cataracts, and sometimes reverses cataracts."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eating plenty of raw fat and the foods suggested in Alkalizing Food, page 178, soothes the overall toxic condition of the body due to excess adrenaline."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Starches are usually necessary for people with celiac disease.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Therefore, eating a Nut Formula (page 194) at least twice weekly usually prevents extreme anxiety."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, if the Nut Formula does not satisfy starch cravings or settle extreme anxiety, try eating bread or pasta made with refined unbleached nonfortified wheat."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,People with celiac may become extremely anxious without the Nut Formula or cooked gluten.

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In all cholesterol problems, whether high or low, there is a deficiency in utilizable blood fat, lacteal fat and lymphatic fat."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Some acupressurists work on a person’s hands and feet only.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Some acupressurists like to dig deeply to break free what they call crystals, deposits and other blockages."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Acupressure is often effective.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, the consequential bruises, internal lacerations, fluid leakages and the quantity of toxins that are released are often a problem, creating damage locally and throughout the body, including the heart."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eating a raw diet prevents further accumulations of toxic matter in the body, and through many years, cleanses old accumulations."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"A person suffers bacterial and/or parasitical and/or viral infection because he or she has toxins in the body that need to be detoxified, not because someone has given him or her an unnecessary plague."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"See Common Cold, page 249."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"EATING BEFORE SLEEP is very healthful when on a raw diet because raw food is easy to digest, and the body doesn’t have to go too many hours without a good supply of fresh nutrients during sleep."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After five hours, there is a blood-protein deficiency resulting in red blood cells eating other red blood cells."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That cannibalism causes tremendous toxicity that makes many people feel drained and lethargic even after 8-10 hours of sleep.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Therefore, it is healthiest to wake after 5 hours to drink 1⁄2-1 cup of room-temperature raw milk, or raw milk shake, or 2 raw eggs."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Dr. Francis Pottenger’s logs document the effects of animal excrement on plant growth.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Three control groups of cats were employed in the following experiment: All animals were fed the same foods but the foods were prepared differently for each group.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Group #1 was fed raw foods, Group #2 was fed cooked foods, and Group #3 was fed processed, cooked and packaged foods."

ELECTRO DERMAL SCREENING DEVICES (EDSD, or EDD): Using biofeedback, computerized electrical devices attempt to diagnose health problems."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, when electricity is used to rebalance the body, there can be serious repercussions."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In the case of EDSDs, the computer sends electrical signals to the brain and body that are believed to be the frequencies of a healthy person."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"But those idealized frequencies are relative to the programmer’s understanding of health, which may be biased or prejudiced against important bodily functions or substances, such as the production of mucus, bacteria, parasites and virus."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The fact that every human body is different and emits varied electrical frequencies negates the ideological validity of EDSD.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The electrical signals supplied by the EDSD machine may or may not give the body false ideas about its needs and state of well being.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Consequently, the body’s systems might fail to respond properly, healthfully."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The epoxy-detoxification and cancerous burn that I mentioned earlier on pages 213-214, was forced by an EDSD treatment."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Hindsight is too late, as we all know, and I regret having agreed to be electrically treated with the EDSD."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Is EDSD an electrical brainwashing (reprogramming) of bodily functions?
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I don’t know enough about it, and I was under the impression that the therapist was simply diagnosing me, not treating me with EDSD."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,People defending EDSD said that the therapist treated me on the machine for too long and therefore I experienced violent side effects.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,One of those many side effects was that my body stopped producing protective and cleansing mucus that would have bound and flushed the epoxy without having caused cancer and the severe third- degree burns to my skin and eye and the excruciating pain.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Another side effect of the EDSD is that I felt hyperactive and anxious, making it difficult for me to relax or sleep more than three hours at a time."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If I wanted to sleep longer, I had to sleep in a hot bath for 1-3 hours and then sleep in bed for 2-3 hours."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I had to lie on grass and ground for 40 minutes per day to reduce the feeling that I was constantly being exposed to excessive electrical charge.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The EDSD computer diagnosed me as having many problems that I didn’t have until after it treated me for them.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In one case, the EDSD machine diagnosed me as having sensitivity to sunlight."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Until then, I was able to sun-gaze easily and enjoy intense sunlight into my brain for long periods."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After EDSD

HEALTHMETHODOLOGIES 333
treatment, I experienced an uncanny sensitivity to sunlight that affects me to this day (2005)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It has caused an intense furrowing of my brow that has caused many lines to develop.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Still, I cannot stare into the sunlight for more than a few seconds."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The EDSD also diagnosed and treated me for allergies I did not have but developed immediately after the EDSD treatment.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Like medicine, EDSD seems to be very risky."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,EXERCISE increases circulation and sometimes releases and spends difficult-to-utilize stored cooked fats; therefore exercise is healthy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, when the combination of a raw diet and exercise is not appealing, exercise is not necessary."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Exercising when feeling anxious, or feeling a need to be active, is healthful."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Exercise spends excess hormones that cause such restlessness.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Hatha yoga postures are good for stretching when one is feeling tight but not wanting strenuous exercise.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Proper breathing is very often the most important exercise.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Breathing exercises increase oxygen and carbon dioxide utilization.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Therefore, breathing exercises increase health of body and mind."

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eating 1 cup whole moldy blackberries blended with 1⁄2 cup good mineral water sometimes caused miscarriage, usually within 2 weeks of eating them. ("

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Vigorously rubbing 4 drops of cold-pressed pennyroyal oil (instead of tincture) directly onto the cervix, usually caused abortion within 3 days, usually with intense labor pains."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Regardless how miscarriage may occur, have remedies for hemorrhage ready (see Hemorrhage, page 270)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"At first signs of miscarriage, begin taking hemorrhage remedies to prevent radical infection and excessive bleed."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"FASTS, that is, not eating or drinking food, starve healthy cells as well as weak cells."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After 5 hours of not eating or drinking food, cells become cannibalistic and eat each other, causing extreme systemic toxicity. ("

We_Want_To_Live.txt,Gradually detoxifying the body through good nutrition is a more loving way to care for our bodies.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"See Detoxification, page 255."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,My next book will discuss and suggest many effective methods to healthfully inspire and speed detoxification.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"FRESH AIR AND SUNSHINE: Getting as much of those as you can reduces the need for lengthy detoxification, and makes detoxification easier."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Sunshine does not create skin cancer.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"A deficiency of utilizable fat in the skin prevents proper absorption of sun rays and prevents the skin’s ability to transform sun rays into vitamin D. Resultantly, the skin burns and dries, creating vast amounts of dead cells that the body can’t afford to discard."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Skin cancer develops in people who are especially deficient in utilizable fat in the skin.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"The fat deficiency is from not eating fat, especially raw fat, or the inability to utilize cooked and processed fat, or the application of any skin lotion (including all suntan lotions) because skin lotions smother and poison the skin."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It is imperative that we do not shower or bathe the morning of a day of sunbathing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Washing removes the body’s natural oils that are a natural sunblock.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Rubbing a little unrefined cold-pressed-below-96° Fahrenheit coconut or peanut oil into the skin the night before sunbathing promotes tanning and reduces the likelihood of burn.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"People who had normally sunburned easily before eating a raw diet

HEALTHMETHODOLOGIES 335
(which included plenty of raw fat) were able to sunbathe without sunblocks and without burning after 1-5 months."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,It is best to start sunbathing in short periods (as much time as feels comfortable).
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Those who experience many months each year without sunbathing may have to burn a little each year.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"See Burns, page 235."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,FRUITARIANISM is following a diet that consists of eating only fruit.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A fruitarian diet cleanses the body but does not build and strengthen it.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Bones, teeth, nerves, and tissue in general deteriorate when fed mainly fruit."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Most people on mainly fruitarian diets lack focus and clarity, and are excessively emotional."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"HAIR SPRAY SUBSTITUTE: Store-bought hair sprays damage hair and are very toxic to the sinuses, bronchi, lungs, blood, scalp, brain and entire body."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,A natural hair spray can be easily made by mixing 11⁄2 teaspoons unheated honey into 1 cup of good mineral water.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Pour into a spray bottle and use as you would normally use hair spray. (
We_Want_To_Live.txt,That mixture will eventually ferment.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,In warm temperatures it may last as little as 3 days.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If kept in a cool place, it will last as long as 10 days.)"
We_Want_To_Live.txt,HERBS AND HERBAL THERAPY are the use of plants as remedies for all maladies.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The success rate of herbal therapies is double that of the medical profession.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"In conjunction with a healthy raw diet, fresh herbs stimulate and promote better health and ease detoxification."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, when herbs are steeped, cut, powdered or processed using heat above 90° Fahrenheit, they create as much toxicity as they supply healing properties."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They cause an overly acidic digestive environment, blood and neural fluids."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If digestion is impaired, all other bodily processes are impaired also, and health suffers."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If a person is in need of the effects of an herb, it would be best to eat or juice the fresh herb."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"But if the fresh herb cannot be obtained, steeping the dried herb in water in the sun for a long afternoon, or for 24 hours, then adding the raw juice of 1⁄4 fresh lemon and 1-3 tablespoons unheated honey to each cup before drinking it minimizes toxicity."

HOMEOPATHY is treating disease by drugs, given in minute doses, which would produce in a healthy person symptoms similar to those of the disease."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Homeopathic medicine has twice the success rate of Western medicine.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, too often I have seen that homeopathy is like Western medicine in that both are remedial and not curative."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,They arrest symptoms without eliminating the cause of disease.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,METABOLIC TYPES AND METABOLIC TYPING consider that people who metabolize differently should eat different foods.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"That is, because some people are extremely athletic or non-physical, or somewhere in between, it is believed that each of those types should eat different foods."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I have not found any long-term empirical evidence that supports those theories.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"All tribes contain individuals who metabolize differently, yet they consume the same foods daily without distress or disease."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,I have received many patients who developed serious disease or increased symptoms of their diseases by adhering to the suggestions postulated by people who promote Metabolic Typing.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"I strongly disagree with Metabolic Typing because it prohibits or restricts important foods from people who need those foods, especially raw meats and dairy, and advises foods that cause toxicity, and preferably should not be eaten."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"PETS, like all creatures, have eaten raw foods for millions of years."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Feeding pets dried, processed and cooked foods causes them to develop discomfort, illness and disease."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Research documenting this is available through the Price-Pottenger Foundation (see Bibliography, page 340)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"PREGNANCY, as every one knows, is the process of growing a child."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"How that child grows depends on genetics, what the mother eats, and what drugs the mother takes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Every drug alters the genetic structure or weakens the DNA and RNA of some young cells.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Therefore, it is best not to take medication, especially during pregnancy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The stress factors are tremendous during pregnancy.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Not only is the mother responsible for carrying the extra being, her body also feeds the child and discards the child's wastes."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"If what the fetus needs is not present and freely available in the lymph and blood of the mother, the placenta calls for and leaches protein and other nutrients from the

HEALTHMETHODOLOGIES 337
mother’s cells, via the production of certain hormones."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Many women nowadays age 2-8 years with each pregnancy, resulting from the leaching process."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"To prove how important utilizable proteins are during pregnancy, take a look at how many women lose muscle tone during and shortly after pregnancy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Muscle tissue is not the only tissue that is leached from the mother if utilizable protein and fat aren’t available in the blood and lymph.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Also, glandular, nerve, brain, arterial and bone cells are leached."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eating plenty of raw meat and fat before and during pregnancy grows a strong healthy child (genetics allowing) and prevents the mother from sacrificing her body for her child.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Nausea during pregnancy indicates that the mother’s system is too acidic and toxic.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eating red meat may cause more nausea and vomiting even if the red meat is raw.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Therefore, if experiencing morning sickness, it is best to follow the suggestions in Alkalizing Food, page 178, and eat raw white meat, especially raw fish, and unripe pineapple or other unripe fruit with a raw fat."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Many women who cannot discard the accumulation of wastes - fetal and their own - during pregnancy, usually bloat with fluids, or get fat during or after pregnancy."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"They retain the wastes within their bodies, bound in difficult-to-discard cooked fat and fluids."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Eating plenty of raw fat before and during pregnancy usually prevents bloating and fat retention.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"However, if bloating or fat retention occurs when eating raw fat, it usually gives women more strength."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,The fluid and fat can be more readily discarded within months after birthing when fat is eaten raw.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"After bathing, daily massaging unheated-above-96° Fahrenheit fermented coconut oil, or peanut oil, or stone-pressed olive oil into thighs, buttocks, hips, abdomen and breasts, reduces or eliminates the formation of stretch marks (scars)."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Wipe off excess after 15-20 minutes.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Sexual intercourse with orgasm during the eighth month often makes the blood too rich in hormones for the fetus to properly establish brain functions.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Kissing and petting without orgasm is good. (

We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Therefore, most healing occurs during sleep."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"A nap daily is not only a beauty aid, it is rejuvenating physically, emotionally and mentally."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"When on a healthy raw diet, situations that seemed so complex, difficult, or futile before a nap are often magically reduced to something more solvable after a nap."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"To help yourself sleep better and become healthier, sleep, or at least nap, when tired."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"STRETCH MARKS, SCARS AND WRINKLES result from poor healing because of poor nutrition."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Eating raw meat, and raw fat like avocados, raw cream and butter, unheated-above-96o Fahrenheit fermented coconut oil, and stone-pressed olive oil, prevents or very gradually reduces stretch marks and scars."
We_Want_To_Live.txt,Applying raw red meat to wrinkles over night feeds and nourishes the skin and reduces wrinkles.
We_Want_To_Live.txt,"Topically, vigorously rubbing a mixture of 2 tablespoons fresh raw papaya and 1 tablespoon unheated-above-96o Fahrenheit fermented coconut oil or stone-pressed olive oil into the skin once weekly helps to gradually remove stretch marks and scars."
